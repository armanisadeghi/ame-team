# THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

This is the BIG BIG thing we really need to create

The hard part is to create something that is as good as the others I've made

Once you start working on this, you'll really appreciate the others.

I have A TON of code written to do various things with text, but...
it's not all together in an organized and reliable way, like the others.

I will move the scripts over here, but it's going to be a lot of work.

In some ways, text is much easier to work with, but in other ways,
it's really hard because there are no limits to the rules or the things
you have to do with text.

It will appear easy at first, but when you try to automate it, 
it will be very hard to do it with consistency and reliability.
