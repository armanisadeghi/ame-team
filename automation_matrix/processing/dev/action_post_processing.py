# Project Overview:
* Project Name: Solar Power Analysis
* Description: A comprehensive analysis of global solar power usage trends.
* Contributors: John Doe, Jane Smith

## Goals:
* Evaluate current solar power installations worldwide.
* Forecast future growth in solar energy.

### Sub-Goals:
* Identify leading countries in solar power.
* Analyze the impact of government policies on solar energy adoption.

## Data Sources:
* [Global Solar Power Database](https://solarpower.example.com)
* [Renewable Energy Statistics](https://renewablestats.example.com)

### Primary Data Source:
* Name: SolarDataHub
* URL: `https://solardatahub.example.com`
* Description: A repository of global solar energy usage data.

## Methodology:
* Data Collection: Using APIs and public datasets.
* Data Analysis: Statistical analysis with Python.
  - Tools:
    * Python 3.8
    * Pandas for data manipulation
    * Matplotlib for data visualization

### Detailed Steps:
1. Data Collection:
   - Download data from SolarDataHub using Python requests.
   - Aggregate data from multiple sources.
2. Data Cleaning:
   - Remove incomplete records.
   - Normalize data formats.
3. Data Analysis:
   - Calculate growth rates.
   - Compare data year-over-year.

## Results:
* Solar power usage has increased by 25% over the last five years.
* Government incentives significantly impact adoption rates.

### Key Findings:
* The top three countries in solar energy adoption are A, B, C.
* There's a strong correlation between policy support and installation rates.

## Conclusion:
* Solar energy is on a rapid growth path.
* Continued support and investment are crucial for future growth.

### Recommendations:
* Increase government incentives.
* Support research and development in solar technology.
