ama_sample_3 = """It sounds like you opened Chrome's Developer Tools in a mode that persists across sessions, possibly related to service worker inspection or another advanced debugging feature. Here's how you can try to resolve this:

### Closing Chrome Developer Tools

Normally, Chrome Developer Tools can be toggled on and off by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Opt+I` (Mac). However, if they keep reappearing every time you close them, it might be due to an accidental configuration or a glitch.

### Clearing Service Workers

Since the issue started after inspecting service workers, let's try clearing them:

1. **Open Chrome Developer Tools**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Opt+I` (Mac).
2. **Go to the Application Tab**: Click on the "Application" tab at the top of the Developer Tools window.
3. **Find Service Workers**: In the left sidebar of the Application tab, look for the "Service Workers" section.
4. **Unregister Service Workers**: You should see a list of service workers registered by various websites, including `localhost`. Click on "Unregister" for any service workers related to `localhost` or your project.

### Resetting Chrome Developer Tools

If the Developer Tools window keeps popping up due to a configuration issue, resetting the Developer Tools settings might help:

1. **Open Chrome Developer Tools**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Opt+I` (Mac).
2. **Open Settings in Developer Tools**: Click on the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Developer Tools window, or press `F1` while the Developer Tools window is focused.
3. **Reset to Defaults**: In the Settings pane, find the "Restore defaults and reload" button (usually at the bottom) and click it. This will reset all Developer Tools settings to their default values.

### Checking Chrome Settings

If the issue persists and seems to affect more than just the Developer Tools (e.g., Chrome behaves oddly in other ways), you may want to review Chrome's settings or consider resetting Chrome entirely:

1. **Open Chrome Settings**: Click on the three dots in the upper right corner of Chrome, then select "Settings".
2. **Reset Settings**: Scroll down to "Advanced", find the "Reset and clean up" section, and choose "Restore settings to their original defaults". Note that this will reset your startup page, new tab page, search engine, and pinned tabs, as well as disable all extensions and clear temporary data. It won't delete your bookmarks, history, or saved passwords.

Before you reset Chrome settings, ensure you've backed up or are ready to reconfigure anything as needed. Resetting Chrome can help resolve persistent issues but can also remove customizations you've made to the browser.

If these steps do not resolve the problem, or if there was a specific command or action taken that you believe caused this issue, please let me know for further assistance."""

**Final Report: Summary of Impairment Evaluation and Injury Information**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 46 years old
- Occupational Code: Driver (Specifically, Occupation Designator 5, "Truck Driver")
- Injury Circumstances: The patient was involved in a head-on collision while driving a company truck.

**Medical and Injury Details:**
- **MRI & X-Ray Evaluations:** Performed on the cervical spine, bilateral shoulders, and lumbar spine.
- **Medical History:** History of ACL reconstruction surgery on the left knee approximately 20 years ago. No prior similar injuries, other industrial injuries, or automobile accidents reported.
- **Medications:** The patient has been taking meloxicam and other pain medications.
- **Activities of Daily Living:** Reported difficulties due to symptoms.

**Impairment Summary:**

| Body Part       | DRE Category | Whole Person Impairment Percentage | Industrial % | Non-Industrial % | Specific Evidence Used                         |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| Right Shoulder  | N/A          | 5%                                 | 100%         | 0%               | Tenderness, loss of range of motion, MRI findings            |
| Left Shoulder   | N/A          | 6%                                 | 100%         | 0%               | Tenderness, loss of range of motion, MRI findings            |
| Lumbar Spine    | II           | 7%                                 | 85%          | 15%              | Tenderness, non-verifiable radicular complaints, MRI findings, difficulties with ADL |

**Apportionment and Methodology:**
- **Cervical and Lumbar Spine Impairments:** 85% attributed to the industrial injury, with the remaining 15% considered non-industrial based on unspecified factors.
- **Shoulder Impairments:** 100% attributed to the industrial injury.

Methodology reflected relies on the DRE (Diagnosis-Related Estimates) method for spinal impairments and range of motion assessments for shoulder impairments. However, specifics such as the edition of the AMA Guides used for evaluation, detailed ranges of motion, specific nerves affected by radicular complaints, or a thorough narrative on establishing impairments are not provided within the summary.

**Observations and Missing Information:**

1. **Edition of AMA Guides:** Not specified, crucial for ensuring adherence to current evaluation standards.
2. **Mechanism of Injury Details:** Lacks explicit connection between the collisionâ€™s dynamics and the resultant conditions.
3. **Shoulder Range of Motion:** Absence of specific measurements hinders the verification of impairment ratings accuracy.
4. **Radicular Complaints:** Lack of detail about affected nerves and correlation with MRI scans.
5. **Clinical Examinations:** It's unclear to what extent they informed the impairment ratings beyond imaging studies.
6. **Impact of Left Knee History:** Not assessed in relation to current impairments.
7. **Functional Limitations Details:** Specific difficulties with activities of daily living due to impairments are mentioned but not detailed.
8. **Consideration of Non-Industrial Factors:** During the apportionment process, the specific non-industrial factors considered are not clarified.
9. **Narrative Explanations for Specific Impairment Percentages:** The rationale behind choosing specific impairment percentages within the provided ranges lacks detail.

**Conclusion:**
This report compiles available impairment and injury-related information following an industrial accident involving a truck driver. While it identifies specific impairments with their percentage ratings and causative correlations to the industrial incident, it lacks several descriptive and methodological details essential for a comprehensive evaluation. Further clarification and additional evaluations might be needed for a complete understanding of the patient's condition and the impairment's extents, as well as to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the worker's compensation claim process.
