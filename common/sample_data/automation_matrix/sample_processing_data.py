**Question:** In cases of spinal cord injuries affecting the corticospinal tract, how should impairments that extend to the upper or lower extremities and potentially impact autonomic functions be accurately rated?

**Answer:** When spinal cord injuries involve the corticospinal tract and extend to the upper or lower extremities, it's essential to identify the specific nature and extent of the injury carefully. Use Table 15-6 for guidance on rating impairments of the upper extremities or station and gait impairments for the lower extremities. In instances where autonomic functions, such as bowel, bladder, or neurologic sexual functions, are also impaired, these should be concurrently evaluated and combined with the extremity impairment ratings. This requires a nuanced understanding of different spinal cord injury types and their impacts on the corticospinal tract, emphasizing the need for comprehensive assessments and potentially consultation with a spinal cord injury specialist. By thoroughly evaluating both motor and autonomic impairments, physicians can ensure a more holistic and accurate representation of the individual's impairment.

The thoracic spine impairment DRE categories are summarized in Table 15-4.


15.6  DRE: Cervical Spine

15.6a Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Cervical Disorders
For cervical problems localized to the cervical or cervicothoracic region, use Table 15-5. If the cervical spine problem also leads to isolated bowel and/or bladder dysfunction not due to corticospinal damage, obtain the appropriate estimates for bowel and

bladder dysfunction from the gastrointestinal and urology chapters (Chapters 6 and 7) and combine these with the appropriate cervical spine DRE category from DRE I to V, listed in Table 15-5. If the cervical spine problem is due to corticospinal tract involvement, use Table 15-6 alone.

The DRE cervical categories are summarized in Table 15-5.

Figure 15-5 illustrates the relationship of nerve roots to the vertebral level.

The level at which nerve roots exit the spine relative to the vertebrae. The neurologic level of involvement is determined by identifying the lowest normally functioning nerve root.

In prior editions of the Guides, rating spinal cord injury was done either through a combination of DRE categories or in the nervous system chapter. It was decided in this edition to evaluate spinal cord injuries based on the criteria in the nervous system chapter (Chapter 13). These criteria are repeated in this section. For bilateral neurologic or corticospinal tract damage, consultation with a spinal cord injury specialist and review of Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System, is recommended. Thus, for an individual with a spinal cord injury affecting the upper extremities, use Table 15-6 and the appropriate impairment rating for impairment of one or both upper extremities. For impairments involving loss of use of the lower extremities, use the section in Table 15-6 pertaining to station and gait impairment. If there is additional bowel or bladder dysfunction, combine the upper extremity or lower extremity loss with impairments in bladder, anorectal, and/or neurologic sexual impairment as warranted.

Once a class has been selected, the exact value is obtained by combining the value with the corresponding additional impairment from DRE categories II through V for cervical and lumbar impairment and DRE categories II through IV for thoracic impairment. An exact value is determined based on the degree of impairment of ADL. Table 15-6 and the following examples illustrate the method for impairment rating of spinal cord injury.

All impairment estimates shown in the tables of this section are expressed as whole person impairments. Section 15.13 explains how to express a whole person spine impairment as a regional spine impairment. Tables 15-8 through 15-14 provide estimates for rating ankylosis and range of motion, while neurologic impairments are rated based on Tables 15-15 through 15-18. The data on standards and normal functioning described in this section are based on both medical studies and consensus judgments.15,18-27

Passive motion is that produced by an external force to determine the freedom and range of motion existing at a joint when all muscles are relaxed. An example,
is Bunnell's test for intrinsic tightness in the hand. Assisted active motion is the result of active muscle contraction and an external force applied to the joint; it allows for stabilization of a segment to improve the mechanical advantage of the muscles that move the joint being measured. In both cases, approximately 0.5 kg of force is applied while a segment of the joint is stabilized. Measurements of active motion take precedence in the Guides. The actual measured goniometer readings or linear measurements are recorded.

Many different factors can limit the normal range of motion of the joints of the upper extremities.
Limitation of active motion can be due to failure of the nerve, muscle, or tendon to execute the motion. Limitation of passive motion can be from involvement of the joint itself, a fixed contracture, or the antagonistic muscle or tendon that holds back the motion because it is adherent or too short. Sound clinical knowledge and measurement techniques are necessary for appropriate impairment evaluation and rating.

Digital joints are measured with the wrist held in neutral position and the forearm pronated. To measure the ROM of individual joints, the proximal joint(s) are stabilized in extension, and only the joint being measured is flexed. Note that if all three joints are flexed simultaneously, as in making a fist, active flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint will be decreased. In some cases of decreased finger motion due to limited excursion of the activating musculotendinous unit or blockage of motion by the antagonistic musculotendinous unit, the measurement of individual joints, as described earlier, can be normal or near normal. In these situations, the total active range of motion (TAM) of the digit is measured.
Flexion of each joint is measured while all three joints are held in a position of maximum active flexion, or the finger is flexed as a whole unit; similarly, extension of each joint is measured while all three joints are held in maximum extension. The methods used to derive motion impairment of a digit using individual joint measurements and the total active range of motion of a digit are different, as explained on p. 465, Combining Abnormal Motion at More Than One Finger Joint. The joint measurement technique that best reflects the existing impairment is selected.


16.4 b Principle for Motion Impairment Calculation: A = E + F
The arc of motion is the total number of degrees of excursion measured between the two extreme angles of a plane of motion of a joint, for example, from maximum extension to maximum flexion. When there is complete loss of joint motion, or ankylosis, the total number of degrees of lost motion (A) equals the sum of lost extension degrees (E) and lost flexion degrees (F), or A = E + F. A always equals the total number of degrees of the normal arc of motion.

The origins and functions of the peripheral nerves that serve the upper extremities are summarized in Table 16-12. The motor innervation of the upper extremity is shown in Figure 16-47. The cutaneous innervation and related nerves are shown in Figure 16-48, the dermatomes of the upper extremities in Figure 16-49, and a schematic diagram of the brachial plexus in Figure 16-50.

Impairment Determination Method
Use the following method to evaluate the impairment resulting from each peripheral nerve structure:


1. If sensory deficits or pain is present, localize the distribution and relate it to the nerve structure involved (Table 16-12 and Figures 16-48, 16-49,
and 16-50).

2. If motor deficits or loss of power is present, identify the key muscles involved and relate the motor deficit to the nerve structure(s) involved (Table 16-12 and Figures 16-47 and 16-50).

3. Grade the severity of sensory deficits or pain according to Table 16-10a and/or that of the motor deficits according to Table 16-11a.

4. Find the values for maximum impairment of the upper extremity due to sensory and/or motor deficits of the nerve structure involved: individual spinal nerve (Table 16-13), brachial plexus (Table 16-14), and major peripheral nerves (Table 16-15).

5. For each nerve structure involved, multiply the grade of severity of the sensory and/or motor deficits (see step 3 above) by the appropriate maximum upper extremity impairment value (see step 4 above) to determine the upper extremity impairment percent for each function.

6.
For a structure with mixed motor and sensory fibers, determine the upper extremity impairment for each function (steps 1 through 5), then combine the sensory and motor impairment percents (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment value.

7. When more than one nerve structure is involved, combine their respective upper extremity impairment values (steps 1 through 5) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment resulting from peripheral nerve disorders (Combined Values Chart).

8. When multiple impairments of the extremity are present because of amputation, loss of motion that is not strictly attributed to a peripheral nerve lesion, or peripheral vascular disorders, combine the peripheral nerve upper extremity impairment value with the other upper extremity impairment values (Combined Values Chart) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment.

9. The total upper extremity impairment is converted to a whole person impairment by means of Table 16-3.

10. If there is bilateral upper extremity involvement, determine separately the impairment values for each side, and convert them to whole person impairment. Combine the whole person impairment values for each side (Combined Values Chart) to obtain the total whole person impairment. Consult page 435 for further comments on bilateral upper extremity involvement.

Grading Sensory Deficits or Pain
A wide range of abnormal sensations may be associated with peripheral nerve lesions, including diminished sensation (anesthesia or hypesthesia), abnormal sensation (dysesthesia or paresthesia), and increased sensation (hyperesthesia). Another possible manifestation is pain of various types, including pain resulting from nonnoxious stimulus (allodynia), overreactive pain (hyperpathia), a state of dysesthetic pain (deafferentation), and, most significantly, the sustained, burning pain present in CRPS I (RSD)

For each nerve, multiply the severity grade by the max impairment value to determine the impairment percent for each function (sensory and motor).\n5. Combine the sensory and motor impairments for each nerve separately using the Combined Values Chart.\n6. Combine the total impairment values for both the median and ulnar nerves using the Combined Values Chart to obtain the total upper extremity impairment.\n7. If necessary, convert this to whole person impairment using Table 16-3.",
        "Question 4: A patient reports sustained, burning pain in the forearm suggestive of CRPS I (RSD). How is this condition evaluated and rated for impairment based on the AMA Guides?",
        "Answer 4: For a patient presenting with CRPS I (RSD) characterized by sustained, burning pain in the forearm, the evaluation and rating process would involve:\n1. First, confirming the diagnosis of CRPS I through clinical assessment and correlating the symptoms to peripheral nerve damage that could contribute to CRPS I.\n2. Since CRPS I involves complex pathophysiology, including both sensory disturbances and potentially motor function impairment, thorough documentation of all symptoms is crucial.\n3. Grading the severity of sensory deficits or pain should accord with the specific criteria outlined for CRPS I, likely relying on patient descriptions and clinical findings.\n4. Consult the AMA Guides to identify any specific guidelines for CRPS I, as treatment and impairment rating might differ from other peripheral nerve injuries. Typically, this requires a comprehensive approach that considers the multifaceted nature of CRPS I, including pain, sensitivity, and potential motor impairment.\n5. Calculate the impairment based on the guidance for pain conditions and sensory deficits provided, often requiring a more subjective evaluation compared to direct nerve damage.\n6. If CRPS I leads to motor deficits or other specific impairments, each should be evaluated and rated accordingly, then combined to reflect the total impairment accurately.\n7. The assessment should conclude with determining the upper extremity impairment, which then may be converted into whole person impairment via Table 16-3, reflecting the broader impact of CRPS I on the individual's functions.",
        "Question 5: When assessing a patient for workers' compensation due to bilateral upper extremity impairment resulting from peripheral nerve injuries, what steps should be followed according to the AMA Guides to calculate the total whole person impairment?",
        "Answer 5: In assessing bilateral upper extremity impairment resulting from peripheral nerve injuries for workers' compensation purposes:\n1. Start by individually assessing each upper extremity following the outlined steps for impairment determination due to peripheral nerve injuries, which involve localizing sensory and motor deficits, grading these deficits, and determining the impairment percent for each affected nerve structure.\n2. For each extremity, calculate the impairment values for the involved nerve structures, then combine these values using the Combined Values Chart to obtain the total upper extremity impairment for each side.\n3. Convert the total upper extremity impairment for each side into whole person impairment using Table 16-3, ensuring separate calculations for the left and right extremities.\n4. Use the Combined Values Chart to combine the whole person impairment values for each side. Pay special attention to consult page 435 for comments and guidance on how to appropriately account for bilateral impressions, as bilateral conditions can have a more significant impact on a person's overall function and may not be simply additive.\n5. This comprehensive approach ensures an accurate representation of the patient's total impairment, taking into account the combined effect of bilateral upper extremity impairments, which is crucial for fair compensation in workers' compensation cases.",
        "Question 6: Is this a sample question?\n- But we also need some bullet points.\n- So, we can test the formatting.\n1. Yes. It certainly is.\n2. We have to do some testing."
