7.8 Female Reproductive
	Organs
The female reproductive organs include the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Female reproductive system impairment is influ- enced by age, especially if the woman is of child- bearing age. Consider the physiologic differences between premenopausal and postmenopausal women when evaluating and estimating female reproductive organ impairment.15


7.8a Vulva and Vagina
The vulva has cutaneous, sexual, and urinary func- tions. Urinary function is discussed in the first part of this chapter on the urethra (Section 7.6). The vagina has a sexual function and also serves as a birth pas-


sageway. The clitoris is an erectile organ that has an important role in sexual functioning.

Vulval and vaginal function impairment symptoms and signs include sensation alteration or loss; lubri- cation loss; partial or complete absence; vulvovagini- tis; vulvitis; vaginitis; cicatrization; ulceration; stenosis; atrophy or hypertrophy; neoplasia or dys- plasia; difficulties with sexual intercourse, urination, or vaginal delivery; and underlying perineal structure support defect.

7.8c Cervix and Uterus
The cervix serves as a passageway for spermatozoa and menstrual blood, maintains closure of the uterus during pregnancy, and serves as a portion of the birth canal during vaginal delivery. Hormones, elaborated by the ovaries or administered exogenously, influ- ence the uterus. The uterus serves as the organ of menstruation, a means of spermatozoa transporta- tion, and the container of fertilization products. The uterus supplies the power for the first and third stages of labor and, in part, for the second stage.

Cervical and uterine functional impairment symp- toms and signs include abnormalities of menstrua- tion, fertility, pregnancy, or labor; excessive cervical canal size, stenosis, or atresia; cervical incompetence during pregnancy; noncyclic hemorrhage; uterine displacement; dysplasia; and neoplasia.

Objective techniques useful in evaluating cervical and uterine function include (but are not limited to) cervical mucous studies; vaginal, cervical, and intrauterine cytologic smears; biopsy; ultrasound; radiologic studies using radiopaque contrast media; blood and urine hormone studies; basal body temper- ature recordings; sperm concentration, mobility, and viability studies; uterus dilation and curettage; endometrium microscopic study; gynecography; laparoscopy; computed tomography; magnetic reso- nance imaging; hysteroscopy; ultrasound placental localization techniques; and saline solution sonohys- terography.

8.8 Skin Impairment Evaluation Summary
Introduction
This chapter provides criteria for evaluating perma- nent impairment of the skin and its appendages and estimating the extent to which skin impairments affect the ability to perform activities of daily living (see Table 1-2). Permanent impairment of the skin is any dermatologic abnormality or loss that persists after medical treatment and rehabilitation and that is unlikely to change significantly in the next year, with or without medical treatment.

Table 8-1 summarizes skin components, functions, and disorders. Skin functions include: (1) providing a protective covering; (2) participating in sensory perception, temperature regulation, fluid regulation, electrolyte balance, immunobiologic defenses, and trauma resistance; and (3) regenerating the epidermis and its appendages.


173


*Modified from Mathias,5 Table 10-7, p. 138.


Protective skin functions include barrier defenses against chemical irritant and allergic sensitizer damage, microorganism invasion, and ultraviolet light injuries. Temperature regulation involves proper sweat gland and small blood vessel functioning. The barrier defense against fluid loss is related to the intactness of the stratum corneum.

Revisions from the fourth edition include: (1) new sections on contact dermatitis and natural rubber latex allergy; (2) a new section on cancer; and (3) updated clinical information and references.


8.1 Principles of
	Assessment
Before using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides’ purpose, applications, and methods for per- forming and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.

Skin disorders may develop from exposure to physi- cal, mechanical, biological, and chemical agents.
Identification and avoidance of these agents may pre- vent ongoing skin disorder aggravation. Physicians need to determine the clinical course and permanence

of skin disorders associated with possible intermittent exposures.

Clinical evaluation requires sound clinical judgment based on a detailed medical history, thorough physi- cal examination, and judicious use of diagnostic pro- cedures. Ancillary diagnostic and laboratory procedures include patch, open, prick, intracuta- neous, and serologic allergy tests; Wood’s light examinations, cultures, and scrapings for bacteria, fungi, and viruses; and biopsies.

To determine the appropriate impairment class (Table 8-2) for an affected individual, evaluate the severity of the skin condition and the impact of the skin con- dition on the ability to perform activities of daily liv- ing (see Table 1-2). Determine the appropriate percentage within any impairment class by consider- ing the frequency, intensity, and complexity of the medical condition and the treatment regimen. In gen- eral, the more frequent and intense the symptoms, signs, and medical treatment, the higher the estimated impairment rating within any impairment class. Table 8-2 lists the impairment classes and percents of whole person impairment for all dermatologic disorders. A brief overview of those disorders follows.

Impairments of other body systems, such as behav- ioral problems, restriction of motion or ankylosis of joints, and respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, or gastrointestinal tract disorders, may be associated


with skin impairments. When there is a permanent impairment of more than one body system, evaluate the extent of whole person impairment related to each system and combine the estimated impairment percentages (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine total impairment.


8.1a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs
In some cases, limitations in the ability to perform daily activities are based on symptoms. This infor- mation may be subjective and possibly misinter- preted, and it should not serve as the sole criterion for impairment rating decisions. Rather, obtain objective data about the extent of the limitation and integrate findings with subjective data to estimate the permanent impairment rating.


8.1a.1 Pruritus
Pruritus is a common symptom of dermatologic con- ditions. Pruritus is a subjective, unpleasant sensation and symptom that provokes the desire to scratch and rub the skin. The itching sensation may be intolera- ble. Pruritus is closely related to pain and is medi- ated by pain receptors and fibers when they are weakly stimulated. Like pain, pruritus may be defined as a unique complex of afferent stimuli that interacts with the individual’s emotional or affective state of mind.

The pruritus sensation has two elements that are extremely variable in makeup and time. Peripheral neural stimulation varies from the absence of sensa- tion to awareness that stimuli are producing a usual or unusual sensation. Central nervous system reac- tion is modified by state of attentiveness, experience, motivation at the moment, and such stimuli as exer- cise, sweat, and temperature change.

When evaluating pruritus associated with skin disor- ders, consider (1) how the pruritus interferes with performance of the activities of daily living, and (2) to what extent the pruritus description is supported by such objective skin signs as lichenification, exco- riation, or hyperpigmentation. Subjective itching complaints that cannot be substantiated objectively may require referral or consultation.


8.1b Description of Procedures
Common clinical investigations for dermatologic conditions include skin testing, biopsy, and relevant laboratory studies.
8.1
b.1 Patch Testing, Performance, Interpretation, and Relevance
The sine qua non for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis is a properly performed and interpreted patch test. The information from patch testing com- plements an appropriate, detailed history. Patch test- ing may significantly contribute to the diagnosis and management of contact dermatitis.

Be aware that patch testing may yield false-positive and false-negative results. Selecting the proper con- centration of the suspected allergen, vehicle, site of application, and type of patch is critical for proce- dure validity. Making such selections and determin- ing test result relevance require considerable skill and experience.

Interpret a positive or negative patch test result in conjunction with the clinical history and a detailed knowledge of testing procedures. Although appropri- ate test concentrations and vehicles have been estab- lished for many sensitizers, there are no established vehicle and concentration standards for the vast number of chemicals in use.

Patch test results require careful interpretation to dis- cern allergic from irritant responses, as well as to appropriately interpret whether the result is relevant to the individual’s dermatitis and exposures. Patch tests are only used to detect contact allergy and are only one component in a complete evaluation.
Further details about patch testing, its values, and its limitations are discussed in standard texts, some of which are listed at the end of this chapter.


8.2  Disfigurement
Skin disfigurement is an altered or abnormal appearance that may be an alteration of color, shape, or structure, or a combination of these.
Disfigurement may be a residual of injury or disease, or it may accompany a recurrent or ongoing disorder. Examples of disfigurement include giant pigmented nevi, nevus flammeus, cavernous hemangioma, and pigmentation alteration.

Disfigurement usually has no effect on body function and may have little or no effect on the ability to per- form activities of daily living, except if the disfigure- ment causes social rejection or an unfavorable
self-image with self-imposed isolation, lifestyle alteration, or other behavioral changes. If impairment in the ability to perform activities of daily living due


to disfigurement does exist, it is usually manifested by a behavior change, such as withdrawal from social contacts. Behavioral changes are evaluated in accordance with the criteria in the Guides Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders.

Evaluate impairments related to disfigurement or altered pigmentation in accordance with the criteria given in Table 8-2 and described later in this chapter. Enhance disfigurement descriptions with good color photographs that show multiple defect views.
Estimate the probable duration and permanency of the disfigurement. Describe in writing the possibility of improving the condition through medical or surgi- cal therapy and the extent to which it can be con- cealed cosmetically, as with hairpieces, wigs, or cosmetics. Depict with photographs if possible.

Evaluate the effect on the performance of the activi- ties of daily living if a scar involves the loss of sweat gland function, hair growth, nail growth, or pigment formation. Evaluate burns and scars according to the criteria in this chapter; give special consideration to the injury’s impact on the individual’s ability to per- form activities of daily living. When impairment resulting from a burn or scar is based on peripheral nerve dysfunction or loss of range of motion, evalu- ate the skin impairment separately and combine the impairment rating with that from Chapters 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System; 16, The Upper Extremities; or 17, The Lower Extremities. If chest wall excursion is limited or if there are behav- ioral changes secondary to disfigurement, consult Chapter 5, The Respiratory System, or Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders.


8.3  Scars and Skin Grafts
Scars, cutaneous abnormalities that result from the healing of burned, traumatized, or diseased tissue, represent a special type of disfigurement. Give the scars’ dimensions in centimeters, and describe their shape, color, anatomic location, and any evidence of ulceration, depression, or elevation. Indicate whether the scar is “atrophic” or “hypertrophic”; soft and pli- able or hard and indurated, thin or thick, and smooth or rough; and attachment, if any, to underlying bones, joints, muscles, or other tissue. Good color photographs with multiple views of the defect enhance the scars’ description.

Consider the tendency of a scar to disfigure when evaluating whether there is permanent impairment due to scarring. Also consider whether the scar can be changed, made less visible, or concealed.
Function may be restored without improving appear- ance, and appearance may be improved without altering function.

Skin grafts may be used to replace skin losses result- ing from trauma or disease. Grafts commonly lack hair, lubrication, pliability, and sensation, and they may demonstrate altered pigmentation. These changes affect the function and appearance of the graft site. The altered lubrication, pliability, and sen- sation may result in diminished protection against microorganisms and diminished resistance to mechanical, chemical, and thermal trauma. The altered appearance may be significant if the area involves exposed parts, such as the dorsum of the hand, the face, or the neck.
8.4
 Contact Dermatitis
Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin reaction induced by exposure to an external agent and is the most frequent cause of occupational skin disease.
Contact dermatitis most often involves the hands, wrists, and forearms, although any area may be affected. Two types of contact dermatitis are gener- ally recognized: irritant (80% of cases), which results from direct tissue damage, and allergic (20% of cases), in which tissue damage is mediated through type IV delayed cellular hypersensitivity.
Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may coexist in the same person and are often difficult to differenti- ate on physical examination and histologically.

Irritants may be strong (absolute) or weak (marginal). Cumulative exposure to marginal irritants causes most cases of contact dermatitis and may impair the barrier function of the skin, allowing the penetration of potential allergens. Many cutaneous allergens, such as chromates, nickel salts, epoxy resins, and preservatives, are also primary irritants. Allergy can be induced or maintained by chemicals in concentra- tions insufficient to irritate nonallergic skin. Allergen cross-sensitivity is an important phenomenon in which an individual who is allergic to one chemical (eg, urushiol in poison ivy or poison oak) also will react to structurally related chemicals (eg, in Japanese lacquer, mango, and cashew nutshell oil).


Accurate diagnosis is the key to proper management of contact dermatitis. If the specific agent(s) can be identified (see section on patch testing) and success- fully avoided, full recovery usually is anticipated; but if contact continues, the dermatitis may become chronic and disabling, and it may prevent the indi- vidual from performing some activities of daily living.


8.5 Natural Rubber
	Latex Allergy
Latex allergy generally refers to an IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reaction to one or more protein allergens present in natural rubber latex (NRL) devices, especially gloves. Individuals with spina bifida and health care workers are at particular risk; NRL allergy has become a significant medical and occupational health problem. Clinical manifesta- tions range from contact urticaria and angioedema to allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, asthma, and ana- phylaxis. Contact dermatitis to rubber accelerators and antioxidants added during manufacture has been associated with NRL allergy. A number of NRL- allergic individuals are atopic, with asthma, other environmental type I allergies, and hand eczema.
Symptoms and signs of contact urticaria to NRL may be masked by preexisting hand eczema. Also evalu- ate individuals with NRL allergy for manifestions in other organ systems (eg, respiratory symptoms and asthma). See Chapter 5, The Respiratory System, for an example of NRL-induced asthma.

Allergen avoidance is the current treatment for NRL allergy. When aerosolized, glove powder (an NRL- allergen carrier) can produce respiratory symptoms in susceptible individuals. Affected workers may have to avoid contact with NRL gloves and other NRL-containing products, avoid areas where they might inhale the powder from NRL gloves worn by other workers, and wear a medical alert bracelet.
8.6
 Skin Cancer
Skin cancer is the most prevalent of all cancers. Three main types exist: basal cell carcinoma, squa- mous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer. Predisposing factors include light skin color, inability to tan, sun exposure, blond or red hair, freckling in childhood, therapeutic radia- tion, and arsenic exposure. Several different clinical and histologic types exist; there is also a much less common, inherited condition called the basal cell nevus or Gorlin syndrome. BCC is usually locally invasive, with a small metastatic potential. The main goal of therapy is complete eradication of the tumor with the highest cure rate and the least amount of disfigurement.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) makes up about one fifth of nonmelanoma skin cancers. SCC is more common in individuals with light skin coloration and can arise from excess sun exposure, leading to precancerous actinic keratoses. Environmental risk factors include arsenic, polycyclic aromatic hydro- carbon, chronic infrared heat, and therapeutic radia- tion exposure. SCC may also occur in chronic scars from burns, trauma, and inflammatory processes.
Several clinical and histologic types exist, but SCC is more likely to metastasize, especially from sites involving the lip, dorsal hand, and temple, as well
as in larger, deeper, and more anaplastic lesions. Therapeutic options are the same as for basal cell carcinoma. Sun avoidance and close follow-up are essential in patients with SCC.

Cutaneous malignant melanoma is an increasingly common and lethal malignancy of melanocytes and nevus cells in certain precursor lesions. The increased frequency of melanoma is well docu- mented; rates of incidence are rising more rapidly for this than for any other cancer. The salient challenge for clinicians is to detect and excise melanoma in its earliest stage, as tumor thickness remains the most important prognostic indicator of this malignancy.
Early diagnosis and surgical excision of in situ, or early invasive, melanomas are curative in most indi- viduals. Despite advances in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the efficacy of treatment of advanced melanoma remains limited, and the prog- nosis of metastatic disease remains guarded.


8.7 Criteria for Rating Permanent
Impairment Due to
	Skin Disorders
The impairment criteria for all dermatologic disorders are given in Table 8-2.


*The signs and symptoms of disorders in classes 1, 2, and 3 may be intermittent and not present at the time of examination. Consider the impact of the skin disorder on the ability to perform activities of daily living (see Table 1-2) in determining the class of impairment. Consider the frequency and intensity of signs and symptoms (ie, severity) and the frequency and complexity of medical treatment when selecting an appropriate impairment percentage and estimate within any class (see Introduction).

Current Symptoms: None.
Physical Exam: Hands and arms: no signs of der- matitis.
Clinical Studies: Patch test: strong allergic reaction to 0.1% petrolatum mixture of a nonmercurial preser- vative, 2-n-4-isothiazolin-3-one, used in company’s latex paints. Subsequent evaluation: normal.
Diagnosis: Resolved allergic contact dermatitis caused by preservative.


Example 8-1
0% to 9% Impairment Due to Allergic Contact Dermatitis
Subject: 27-year-old man.
History: Prepared batches of latex paint for small paint manufacturing company. Related skin dis- ease onset and exacerbation. Despite some accommodations, individual unable to avoid latex paint completely; dermatitis continued. No der- matitis for 1 year after job change.

Impairment Rating: 0% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: While used widely in paint manufactur- ing, the preservative is not used in other industries where the worker might come into contact with it. No limitation in the performance of daily activi- ties. Latex paint does not contain natural rubber latex (NRL) allergens and does not cause NRL allergy.


Example 8-2
0% to 9% Impairment Due to Thermal Burn Scarring

Subject: 38-year-old woman.
History: Second-degree flame burn to forearm; spontaneously healed.
Current Symptoms: None.
Physical Exam: 7 x 12-cm depigmented area of the arm. Healed skin: normal pliability, lubrication, and sensation.
Clinical Studies: None.
Diagnosis: Scarring caused by thermal burn.
Impairment Rating: 0% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: No interference with activities of daily living.


Example 8-3
0% to 9% Impairment Due to Allergic Contact Dermatitis and Occupational Leukoderma

Subject: 52-year-old man.
History: Janitor; 13 years’ transient hand dermatitis from wet work with detergents, including germi- cidal disinfectant with paratertiary butyl phenol (TBP). Developed depigmentation on sides of most fingers, dorsa of the hands, and distal fore- arms 10 years ago. Recent depigmentation of upper torso and thighs. Ultraviolet light therapy with oral methoxsalen (PUVA therapy) over 1 year failed to stimulate repigmentation. Cosmetic covering unsatisfactory. Required outdoor mainte- nance work resulted in frequent sunburn of skin that lacked pigmentation; needs frequent and reg- ular use of protective sunscreen.
Current Symptoms: None; not bothered by skin changes.
Physical Exam: Depigmentation. Early actinic changes with skin wrinkling, bruising, and scaling.
Clinical Studies: Patch test: 2+ reaction to TBP 1% in petrolatum; no other common industrial aller- gens. Positive patch site depigmented 1 month later.
Diagnosis: Allergic contact dermatitis and occupa- tional leukoderma caused by phenolic chemical, TBP.
Impairment Rating: 5% impairment of the whole person.

Comment: Impairment estimate includes modifica- tion of only a few activities of daily living by lim- iting exposure to sunlight. No effect on self-image or social relationships.


Example 8-4
0% to 9% Impairment Due to Chronic Urticaria


Subject: 35-year-old woman.
History: 10 years’ chronic urticaria (hives); no angioedema or ER visits due to related symptoms.
Current Symptoms: Hand lesions; swelling occa- sionally interferes with driving or grasping objects. Lesions; severe itching rarely interferes with sleep, sexual relations, concentration, and activities of daily living. Asyptomatic with regular nonsedating antihistimine use.
Physical Exam: Without treatment, daily urticarial lesions on 10% to 20% of body surface area (BSA): hands, face, or trunk.
Clinical Studies: Blood smear (200 white blood cells counted): 12% eosinophils.
Diagnosis: Chronic urticaria.
Impairment Rating: 5% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: No limitation in daily activities with current treatment. If sedating antihistamine treat- ment, ability to perform certain activities—driv- ing or participating in group activities—possibly limited; estimated impairment rating might increase. If change necessary, reevaluate impair- ment rating. If urticaria uncontrollable, possible 20% impairment estimate.


Example 8-5
0% to 9% Impairment Due to Allergic Contact Dermatitis
Subject: 32-year-old man.
History: Construction worker; blistering dermatitis of hands and feet after work with wet concrete. Severe dermatitis twice treated with oral pred- nisone. Condition improved away from concrete contact but did not clear completely.
Current Symptoms: Daily chronic dermatitis with occasional exacerbations. Requires intermittent treatment. Performs most but avoids some activi- ties of daily living; avoids contact with water; normal sleep. Handling dry rock or concrete usu- ally aggravates dermatitis.
Physical Exam: Initial severe dermatitis; without exposure, mild dermatitis of fingers, palms, and feet.
Clinical Studies: Patch test: allergic contact der- matitis to chromate, principal allergen in cement and leather shoes.
Diagnosis: Allergic contact dermatitis to chromate from occupational cement exposure.
Impairment Rating: 9% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Limitation of few activities of daily liv- ing, but daily chronic dermatitis requires intermit- tent treatment.


Example 8-6
10% to 24% Impairment Due to Chronic Dermatitis
Subject: 28-year-old woman.
History: Eczematous eruption beneath wedding ring on fourth finger of left hand shortly after birth of first child 6 years earlier. Gradually spread to areas on several fingers of both hands despite treatment and avoidance of jewelry use. Eruption persisted for several months, then subsided slowly. Severe hand dermatitis flare-up after birth

of second child 2 years later. No eczema, hay fever, or asthma; no family history of atopy.
Current Symptoms: Good general health. Chronic, low-grade dermatitis despite special precautions. Intermittent treatment required to control dermati- tis. Chronic hand dermatitis causes intermittent discomfort and limits some activities of daily liv- ing (eg, dishwashing, childcare, and grasping).
Physical Exam: Scarring and lichenification; other- wise normal.
Clinical Studies: Patch test: various food, house- hold, cosmetic, and diagnostic and therapeutic materials nonreactive. Basic labs: normal.
Diagnosis: Chronic dermatitis of the hands due to undetermined factors.
Impairment Rating: 10% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Chronic dermatitis and impairment of some daily activities indicate class 2. Intermittent nature of symptoms and treatment needed warrant 10% impairment rating.


Example 8-7
10% to 24% Impairment Due to Thermal Burn Hypertrophic Scarring

Subject: 43-year-old man.
History: Healed second-degree burn of anterior part of neck; hypertrophic scar formation involves approximately 1% of body surface area.
Current Symptoms: Scar susceptible to ultraviolet light; wears sun blockers when outdoors. Scar easily irritated and lacks durability; unable to wear clothes that rub neck. Intermittent itching and burning episodes confined to scarred areas stops all activities for 5 to 10 minutes.
Physical Exam: Scar raised, red, hard, and contrasts markedly with adjacent normal skin. Limited neck flexion, extension.
Clinical Studies: None.
Diagnosis: Hypertrophic scar secondary to thermal burn; limitation of neck motion.
Impairment Rating: 10% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Itching and burning temporarily interrupt some activities of daily living; no treatment is required. Combine skin impairment with the esti- mated impairment rating for loss of neck motion (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine total impairment.


Example 8-8
10% to 24% Impairment Due to Latex Allergy and Eczema

Subject: 38-year-old woman.
History: Dental assistant; 18 years’ progressively severe chronic hand dermatitis, angioedema of the face, rhinitis, and asthma; flared with powdered natural rubber latex (NRL) gloves. Treatment of topical and systemic corticosteroids. Eczema; jew- elry allergy. Some lotions, creams, frequent anti- bacterial soap hand washing aggravate dermatitis. Nonpowdered NRL gloves cause itching within minutes, hives on wrists and forearms. Visited urgent care center for disseminated urticaria, angioedema, and wheezing.
Current Symptoms: Temporary improvement with hypoallergenic, powder-free NRL gloves. With no NRL exposure, mild hand dermatitis persists; intermittent fingertip fissuring. Occasional diffi- culty grasping and holding instruments; occasion- ally uses topical corticosteroids and hand creams. Asthma improved but persists despite use of non- NRL gloves by all office employees.
Physical Exam: Red, swollen, crusted, fissured palms, fingers, and wrists.
Clinical Studies: Patch test: positive reactions to thi- uram mix (rubber chemical accelerators in NRL gloves), glutaraldehyde (active ingredient in cold sterilizing solution), and quaternuim-15 (preserva- tive in hand lotions). Latex RAST (Pharmacia CAP): positive (class 3). Prick test: confirmed latex allergy to NRL, bananas, avocado, house dust mites, and various molds.
Diagnosis: Latex allergy and allergic and irritant contact hand eczema.
Impairment Rating: 15% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Persistent dermatitis limits some activi- ties of daily living; intermittent to constant treat- ment needed. Allergen avoidance information includes: non-NRL gloves list, methods of avoid- ing skin and inhalation contact with glutaralde- hyde, quaternium-15–free hand lotion, and methods to avoid NRL exposure at both work and home. Prescription for Epi-Pen (auto- injectable epinephrine). Referred to allergist due to worsening rhinitis, asthma, and banana allergy. Determine impairment due to rhinitis and asthma separately and combine with skin impairment rating (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604)
to determine total impairment.

Example 8-9
10% to 24% Impairment Due to Atopic Dermatitis


Subject: 25-year-old man.
History: Family history of eczema, hay fever; per- sonal history of infantile eczema with chronic, intermittent, oozing lesions of face, scalp, neck, and upper extremities. Persistent lichenified patches in antecubital, popliteal, and neck areas during remissions. Severe exacerbations during high school; frequency increased during college.
Current Symptoms: Exacerbations once a month for 7 to 10 days; involves shoulders, arms, hands, legs, and trunk. Eczema during exacerbations limits some activities of daily living: difficulty sleeping, washing dishes, and concentrating on complex tasks. Lichenified dermatitis an annoy- ance but does not significantly limit daily activi- ties. Intermittent application of topical steroid creams during relative remissions. Constant topical steroids, antihistamines, and oatmeal starch baths during flare-ups. Systemic steroids once a year induce remissions.
Physical Exam: Lichenified areas at lateral aspects of neck and arm, leg creases.
Clinical Studies: Basic labs: normal.
Diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis.
Impairment Rating: 15% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Atopic dermatitis exacerbations precipi- tated by variety of agents. Estimated impairment based on occasional interference with some activi- ties of daily living, frequency and severity of signs and symptoms, and need for and complexity of medical treatment.


Example 8-10
10% to 24% Impairment Due to Nail Dystrophy and Anonychia

Subject: 40-year-old woman.
History: Swelling, redness of eponychial, parony- chial areas of all fingers; severe pain, paresthesia after repeated use of sculptured artificial nail kit consisting of liquid methyl methacrylate monomer and powdered methyl methacrylate polymer. Lost nails on all 10 fingers. Individual observed for several years; no fingernail regrowth.


Current Symptoms: Persistent paresthesia; diffi- culty grasping small objects such as coins; cold sensitivity, burning, and tingling. Other nonspe- cialized hand activities aggravate symptoms.
Wears adhesive bandages over petroleum jelly on nail beds; wears gloves most waking hours.
Woman anxious and depressed; requires occa- sional psychiatric consultation.
Physical Exam: Exposed and keratinized nail beds; paronychial areas swollen and tender.
Clinical Studies: Patch test: positive; 2% methyl methacrylate monomer in petrolatum.
Diagnosis: Chemically induced nail dystrophy and anonychia.
Impairment Rating: 20% impairment due to chemi- cally induced nail dystrophy.
Comment: Combine with appropriate value for the paresthesia (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine whole person impairment. Any men- tal and behavioral impairment would increase the whole person impairment.


Example 8-11
10% to 24% Impairment Due to Zirconium Chloride Burn and Leukoderma

Subject: 30-year-old man.
History: At work splashed with concentrated liquid zirconium chloride over face, scalp, and neck.
Despite immediate irrigation, hospitalized for 2 days for chemical burn. Healing and epithelializa- tion occurred without complications; returned to work 22 days after episode. Months later, depig- mentation occurred.
Current Symptoms: Depigmented areas sunburn easily, with considerable discomfort, restricting ability to work. Contact with heat (eg, hot show- ers, extremely warm days, or work as kiln opera- tor) cause marked stinging sensation within affected skin areas, requiring cessation of all activ- ities for 10 to 15 minutes until pain subsides.
Occasional muscle twitching and severe discom- fort occur within the affected areas, waking indi- vidual from sleep once or twice a week.
Experiences considerable embarrassment when attempting to explain disfigurement; avoids some social activities previously participated in.

Physical Exam: Pigment loss, hyperesthesia, and intolerance to sunlight and warmth. Well-
demarcated areas of depigmentation with borders of hyperpigmentation, surrounding right side of the face (behind right ear to center of face, from midtemple area of scalp to chin, and on left side of neck and behind right ear). Maximum dimen- sions of depigmented areas on right side of face 16 x 11 cm. Neurologic examination: all depig- mented areas hypersensitive to cold, heat, pin- prick, and touch.
Clinical Studies: Basic labs: normal.
Diagnosis: Zirconium chloride burn and leukoderma with residual skin dysfunction.
Impairment Rating: 20% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Percentage of cutaneous impairment reflects decreased ability to perform some activi- ties of daily living. Frequent occurrence of intense signs and symptoms, which precludes the per- formance of various activities, merits a rating at the upper end of class 2 impairment. If effective medical treatment were available to reduce fre- quency and intensity of signs and symptoms, esti- mated impairment percentage could be reduced. Behavioral changes exhibited by individual should be evaluated according to the criteria described in the Guides Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders; any psychiatric impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) would be combined with the skin impairment to determine whole person impairment.


Example 8-12
25% to 54% Impairment Due to Neurodermatitis and Occupational Contact Dermatitis

Subject: 45-year-old man.
History: Nurseryman; exposure to many irritant pesticides. 6 years’ persistent, pruritic dermatitis involving ankles, forearms, hands, and occasion- ally face and neck. Recurrent pyogenic infection with occasional regional lymph node swelling and tenderness. Dermatitis initially responded to topi- cal therapy and irritant avoidance; condition flared up after reexposure. Symptoms continued despite job change, avoidance of incriminated agents. No prior dermatologic problem.
Noteworthy: 3 years’ headache, memory loss, and anxiety with nausea and vomiting. Intermittent psychological counseling with some relief; little neurodermatitis improvement.
Current Symptoms: Neurodermatitis (itch-scratch syndrome); warm environments, sweating, chemi- cal irritants, and stress provoke severe itching.
Physical Exam: Weeping, excoriated, lichenified plaques and patches of eczema of the face, arms, and hands. Axillary adenopathy.
Clinical Studies: Patch tests: negative to standard tray and work chemicals. Bacterial culture of skin drainage: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase posi- tive.
Diagnosis: Persistent neurodermatitis secondary to occupational contact dermatitis.
Impairment Rating: 30% impairment due to the skin disorder; combine with an estimated mental and behavioral impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine whole person impair- ment.
Comment: Unable to fully perform usual activities of daily living or participate in social and recreational activities; difficulty sleeping.

Example 8-13
25% to 54% Impairment Due to Thermal Burn Scarring


Subject: 44-year-old man.
History: Burns to dorsum of both hands and feet; required grafting.
Current Symptoms: Well-healed grafts; residual dry- ness and cracking, easily injured by minor trauma, noxious chemicals. Bathes, shampoos with gloves on since water and soap irritate hands. Trouble grasping toothbrush, comb, or writing instrument due to cracking, decreased sensation, and skin stiff- ness. Feet uncomfortable in leather shoes; wears cloth shoes. Intermittent moisturizer use.
Physical Exam: Dry, somewhat atrophic, and stiff grafts on hands and feet.
Clinical Studies: Basic labs: normal.
Diagnosis: Scarring due to thermal burns.
Impairment Rating: 30% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Many activities of daily living limited. Intermittent treatment and symptoms place him at the lower end of class 3.

3.5  Cardiomyopathies
Cardiomyopathies, caused by a primary disease that affects the heart muscle, lead to impairment from abnormal ventricular function. Abnormal ventricular function may be the result of (1) systolic dysfunc- tion, (2) diastolic dysfunction, or (3) a combination of both. An individual with these abnormalities may be asymptomatic or symptomatic due to pulmonary or systemic organ congestion and decreased cardiac output. In people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a dynamic outflow tract obstruction and secondary mitral regurgitation may cause symptoms of exer- tional dyspnea, angina, and syncope. Because some cardiomyopathies are reversible, every effort should be made to identify the reversible forms and to treat

them appropriately and prevent further deterioration. When the conditions are stable, the individual may be evaluated in terms of permanent impairment.13-18

Cardiomyopathies arise from many mechanisms, but the conditions may be divided into three major types:
(1) dilated or congestive, (2) hypertrophic, and
(3) restrictive. Careful history-taking and physical examination can reveal cardiomyopathies, but it is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis with echocar- diography and selected laboratory studies.


3.5 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Cardiomyopathies Impairment criteria for cardiomyopathies are given in Table 3-9.


Diagnosis: Idiopathic cardiomyopathy.
Impairment Rating: 49% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Reduced exercise capacity; poor LV function.


3.6 Pericardial Heart
	Disease
Inflammation from diseases of the pericardium is associated with (1) systemic illnesses such as lupus erythematosus; (2) a reaction to mechanical forces, such as trauma or irradiation; (3) no obvious cause (idiopathic pericarditis); (4) infections, eg, viral, bac- terial, fungal; or (5) open heart surgery (postcar- diotomy syndrome). The pericardium may also be affected by tumors.

Recurrent pericarditis can lead to disabling episodes of fevers and pleuritic chest pain. Since chest pain is nonspecific, pericarditis evidence must be docu- mented by echocardiography to show a pericardial effusion or by laboratory evidence of active inflam- mation, such as an increase in the erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate (ESR).

Constrictive pericarditis is the most common pericar- dial disorder leading to permanent impairment; surgi- cal removal of the thickened pericardium may significantly reduce symptoms and improve the over- all condition of the individual. Before assessing per- manent impairment, it is mandatory to allow sufficient time for the person to recover from a surgical proce- dure and to reach maximal medical improvement.


Pain and compromised cardiac function because of tamponade may cause some impairment, but they are rare as causes of permanent impairment. Recurrent episodes of pericarditis with tamponade or pericar- dial disease related to tumors may lead to permanent impairment. Allow adequate time for resolution of an acute illness, generally a period of months, before assessing permanent impairment.

Diagnosis of pericardial disease is made by history- taking; identifying a pericardial fraction rub or early diastolic pericardial knock; demonstrating pericar- dial effusion, thickening, or calcification on an echocardiogram; showing a thickened pericardium with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); or findings at cardiac catheterization.


3.6 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Pericardial Heart Disease
Criteria for evaluating permanent impairment related to pericardial heart disease are given in Table 3-10.


Impairment Rating: 0% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Self-limited illness; no effects on activi- ties of daily living.


3.7  Arrhythmias
An arrhythmia is one or more heartbeats generated at a site other than the sinus node. An impulse gener- ated in the sinus node but not transmitted normally through the conducting system is a conduction defect arrhythmia. Arrhythmias may occur in individuals with structurally and functionally normal hearts or in those with any type of organic heart disease.

Because arrhythmias tend to fluctuate remarkably in frequency, the physician must adequately document and estimate the frequency with which an arrhythmia occurs. The associated symptoms can include syn- cope, weakness and fatigue, palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath, alone or in any combination.


The degree of impairment from cardiac arrhythmias often has to be combined with the degree of impair- ment due to underlying heart disease and then calculated according to the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). Before estimating the degree of permanent impairment, allow adequate time for the individual’s condition to reach maximal medical improvement after instituting therapy.19


3.7 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Arrhythmias Criteria for evaluating impairments related to arrhythmias are given in Table 3-11.
