Subject: 55-year-old woman.
History: Cigarette smoker; family history of CHD. CT scan: calcium score in the 99th percentile.
Subsequently referred to physician.
Current Symptoms: Denies angina, dyspnea, or fatigue. Worried about dying of a heart attack because of mother’s death from MI at 62.
Physical Exam: Mild hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol: 215 mg/dL; LDL: 135 mg/dL; HDL: 45 mg/dL). Physician concerned about possible significant CHD; referred her to local cardiovascular specialist. 9 minutes on Bruce protocol: 1.5 mm up-sloping ST depression in V ; normal echo images.
Clinical Studies: Cardiac catheterization: diffuse 40% disease in left circumflex and right coronary arteries; LAD 30% lesion. 0.68 LVEF.
Diagnosis: Asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).
Impairment Rating: 1% to 5% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Mild atherosclerotic CAD according to catheterization and CT scan. Normal exercise tolerance; no symptoms of angina or exertional dyspnea. False-positive stress electrocardiogram result: no cardiac ischemia.

0% to 9% Impairment Due to Coronary Heart Disease


Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Referred to a cardiologist because of abnormal exercise thallium stress test. Denied angina pectoris or dyspnea.
Current Symptoms: Plays golf and tennis regularly; states he has “endurance he had in college.” Nonsmoker; no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or family history of CAD. Concerned because friend and fellow jurist died unexpectedly of a heart attack 2 months earlier. Wanted to know “definitively” if he had any significant CAD because he was then on a short list of possible Supreme Court Justice nominees.
Physical Exam: Normal, including BP and PR.
Clinical Studies: Exercise thallium: normal exercise tolerance (9.0 min, Bruce protocol); peak heart rate (HR): 180 BPM. Total cholesterol: 365 mg/dL; HDL: 45 mg/dL; triglycerides: 225 mg/dL; LDL cholesterol: 275 mg/dL. Catheterization: 50% lesions in proximal and distal LAD. RCA, LCx: scattered 20% and 30% luminal irregularities. 0.65 EF. ECG: Ischemic evidence at HR 170 (1.5 mm ST depression); image changes demonstrated ischemia in the distal anterior wall. Elevated lipids.
Diagnosis: Asymptomatic CAD with silent myocardial ischemia.
Impairment Rating: 5% to 9% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Changes on the exercise thallium stress test indicate a silent myocardial ischemia in a small area of the myocardium. No functional limitations; only mild CAD; could start treatment for hyperlipidemia. Medical therapy could reduce slightly increased risk of acute MI due to mild CAD and hyperlipidemia.

10% to 29% Impairment Due to Coronary Heart Disease

Subject: 48-year-old man.
History: Chest pain for 2 years interrupted his workday. Pain accompanied by diaphoresis and dyspnea. Slightly elevated cholesterol: 245 mg/dL. Family history: 66-year-old father with heart disease.
Current Symptoms: Chest pain; palpitations.
Physical Exam: BP: 140/90 mm Hg; PR: 76 BPM. Occasional ectopic beat; otherwise normal heart sounds.
Clinical Studies: Exercise stress test: completed 14 minutes on treadmill; maximum HR: 172; no evidence of ischemia. Because of the symptoms and the man’s persistence at asking for a second opinion, he was referred to a cardiologist. Cardiac catheterization: 40% stenosis in right coronary artery; no disease in the left system; 0.60 EF. Reassured that he did not have significant CAD, he returned to work. Symptoms persisted for another 6 months; mild palpitations began. Holter monitor: ST segment elevation during palpitation. Second cardiologist suspected coronary artery spasm because of the correlation between the symptoms and mental stress. Ergonovine testing: coronary spasm in the right coronary artery.
Diagnosis: Vasospastic angina pectoris; had coronary artery vasospasm and experienced symptoms only with significant mental stress.
Impairment Rating: 10% to 29% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Coronary artery spasm–related symptoms and hyperlipidemia treatment possible with medication and psychological therapy to decrease stress. Although CAD not significantly obstructive, angina pectoris limited work ability; at risk for ischemia-related complications. Impairment could be adjusted by controlling the vasospastic angina with medical treatment or stress reduction techniques. Greater impairment score if vasospastic angina nonresponsive, more frequent, and less reactive to stress.

Physical Exam: Weight: 70.4 kg (155 lb); preillness weight: 81.7 kg (180 lb). Height: 1.88 m (6 ft 2 in); lanky and gaunt. Normal vital signs.
Clinical Studies: Chest roentgenogram: mediastinum widening; no lung field densities that might indicate aspiration. Barium swallow: markedly dilated and tortuous esophagus terminating in filiform constriction. Endoscopy: no mucosal defect. Successful pneumatic dilation of lower esophageal sphincter after repeated attempts.
Diagnosis: Achalasia of the esophagus.
Impairment Rating: 30% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Symptoms persistent and progressive despite dietary limitation and esophageal dilation; weight loss exceeded 10% of desirable level.
Esophagomyotomy highly recommended due to individual’s age and possible combination of antireflux procedure. Basic defect in achalasia, loss of ganglion cells and nerve fibers, cannot be corrected; therapy goal to prevent progressive proximal esophageal dilation. Successful treatment could reduce impairment to class 2.
Progressive proximal esophageal dilation with failure or omission of treatment may result in class 4 rating.5

25% to 49% Impairment Due to Colonic or Rectal Disease


Subject: 35-year-old man.
History: Computer programmer; Crohn’s disease since age 19. Several hospitalizations that required intensive therapy and transfusion of packed red blood cells to correct anemia.
Current Symptoms: Recurring diarrhea associated with cramping abdominal pain and occasional perianal suppuration with draining fistulas.
Elective proctocolectomy declined.
Physical Exam: Weight remains 20% or more below desirable level. Guaiac-positive stools.
Clinical Studies: Crohn’s disease lesions affecting the perineum, rectum, several colon segments, and the terminal ileum.
Diagnosis: Chronic, recurrent enterocolitis (Crohn’s disease).
Impairment Rating: 45% impairment due to enterocolitis; combine with appropriate anemia impairment estimate to determine whole person impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Comment: Chronic inflammatory bowel disease, while remitting occasionally, interferes with performance of daily activities. Requires continuing close observation and treatment. Impaired nutritional status. Continuing Crohn’s disease activity mostly in colon with only distal ileum involvement; proctocolectomy and Brooke ileostomy may significantly improve the general condition, perhaps with less impairment.

50% to 75% Impairment Due to Colonic or Rectal Disease

Subject: 42-year-old woman.
History: 15 years’ chronic ulcerative colitis. Activity limited; required intensive treatment, including occasional blood transfusion. Persistent fever, anemia, and jaundice.
Current Symptoms: Increasing debility; nutritional deficiency. Further complications of inflammatory bowel disease.

Physical Exam: Cachectic; jaundice and hepatomegaly.
Clinical Studies: Barium enema, colonoscopy: extensive and severe colon involvement. Liver function tests: severely abnormal; liver biopsy: nonsuppurative cholangitic cirrhosis.
Diagnosis: Chronic ulcerative colitis, severe; sclerosing cholangitis with cirrhosis.
Impairment Rating: 60% impairment due to ulcerative colitis; combine with appropriate impairment estimates for the liver disorder and anemia (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine the whole person impairment.
Comment: Declined liver transplantation option.
Physician does not consider colectomy as a therapeutic option due to general debility and advanced, complicated disease. Proctocolectomy has no beneficial effect on sclerosing cholangitis.9 Increased acceptability of new anastomosis such as ileal-pouch anal anastomosis provides greater security and privacy and may lead to earlier surgery in severe ulcerative colitis.

Example 6-23
10% to 19% Impairment Due to Anal Disease


Subject: 32-year-old woman.
History: 14 years’ Crohn’s colitis, usually well controlled by medical therapy. During one exacerbation, developed pararectal abscess that ruptured spontaneously and led to development of chronically draining anal fistula. Later developed small rectovaginal fistula. Anal dysfunction symptoms occasionally recurred; usually tolerably controlled by treatment. Anal fistula surgery attempt inadvisable because of disease extent elsewhere in the rectum and colon.
Current Symptoms: Episodic fecal incontinence.
Physical Exam: Inactive perianal disease.
Clinical Studies: Colonoscopy: Crohn’s disease throughout colon and rectum.
Diagnosis: Chronic anal fistula with moderate impairment of anal function, associated with Crohn’s disease of the colon.
Impairment Rating: 10% impairment due to anal disorder; combine with colonic disease and gynecologic impairment ratings to determine whole person impairment (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Comment: Impaired anal function, but symptoms responsive to treatment when required. Slightly impaired ability to perform activities of daily living.

20% to 35% Impairment Due to Anal Disease

Subject: 56-year-old man.
History: Pararectal abscess that drained spontaneously; 3 years’ recurrent infection; fistulous tracts opened four other areas surrounding anus. Two-stage surgical repair; incision and excision of substantial portions of the anal sphincter muscle. Recovery delayed by wound infections.
Current Symptoms: Perineum eventually healed; no fecal control. Despite daily rectal irrigation, soils himself occasionally.
Physical Exam: Complete functional loss of anal sphincter mechanism.
Clinical Studies: None.
Diagnosis: Anal incontinence due to complete loss of sphincter function.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person.

0% to 14% Impairment Due to Liver Disease
Subject: 30-year-old man.
History: Excessive alcohol consumption.
Hospitalized 5 years ago for severe delirium tremens, fever, and jaundice. Liver biopsy specimen: extensive fatty metamorphosis with steatonecrosis, scattered inflammatory cell infiltration, and minimal periportal fibrosis.
Current Symptoms: Since hospital release, abstains from alcohol, feels well, and exhibits normal vigor and appetite.
Physical Exam: Well-developed, muscular man; no jaundice or ascites. Liver edge was palpated 2 cm below right costal margin.
Clinical Studies: Liver function tests: within normal limits; serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST; formerly serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) level: 1.5 times normal.
Diagnosis: History of acute alcoholic hepatitis and steatonecrosis, with residual slight hepatomegaly, without changes in ability to perform activities of daily living.
Impairment Rating: 0% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Preexisting disease well documented. Satisfactory recovery; only minimal evidence of residual hepatic impairment. Requires no treatment other than continued abstinence from alcohol; engages fully in normal activities of daily living. Most individuals with alcohol abuse history need considerable help from professionals and family to continue abstinence; failure risks recurrent alcoholic hepatitis episodes that, if severe, may be fatal or lead to cirrhosis and class 4 impairment.10

15% to 29% Impairment Due to Liver Disease


Subject: 35-year-old man.
History: Plumber; acute viral hepatitis with a protracted convalescence 10 years ago.
Current Symptoms: Disease quiescent; no visible icterus, ascites, or GI tract bleeding. Satisfactory strength and nutritional state; limited stamina.
Physical Exam: Well nourished and well muscled.
Several small telangiectasias on left shoulder. Nontender, firm, rounded liver edge palpated 4 cm below right costal margin; inferior spleen margin palpated 1 cm below left costal margin.
Clinical Studies: Liver function tests: serum bilirubin, 36 mmol/L (2.1 mg/dL); serum albumin,
40 g/L; serum globulin, 40 g/L; and serum AST, 70 U/L. Positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibodies. Liver biopsy specimen: periportal hepatitis and piecemeal necrosis (now called “interface hepatitis”); early indications of extension between portal tracts and central veins.
Diagnosis: Chronic hepatitis B.
Impairment Rating: 15% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Documented evidence of chronic active hepatitis; can perform normal activities of daily living, although has reduced stamina. Slight to moderate impaired liver function. Chronic hepatitis implies 6 months or more of inflammation; nomenclature for specific forms reflects etiologic or pathologic mechanisms. Cirrhosis likely; progression to class 3 or 4 impairment. Timing this evolution less predictable; may be influenced by treatment programs. Increased impairment if hepatitis C is present with elevated risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.11

30% to 49% Impairment Due to Biliary Tract Disese

Subject: 46-year-old woman.
History: Teacher; concerned about increasing pruritus, loss of strength, and decreased stamina. Itch onset 2 years ago; routine blood chemistry: elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. Ingested no drugs known to cause cholestasis; antimitochondrial antibody test positive.
Current Symptoms: Recent significantly increased impairment: unable to complete all daily activities due to increasing debility.
Physical Exam: Generalized hyperpigmentation, scratch marks, mild jaundice, a few xanthomata, and probable splenomegaly.
Clinical Studies: Laboratory studies: alkaline phosphatase 4 times normal levels; serum bilirubin:
5 mg/dL, positive antimitochondrial antibody. Retrograde cholangiogram: normal extrahepatic ducts. Liver biopsy: small bile ducts damaged, interlobular bile ducts damaged; scarring consistent with primary biliary cirrhosis. Discussed liver transplantation as future consideration.
Responded only minimally to various treatment protocols. Cholestasis increased to 12 mg serum bilirubin. Individual awaited liver transplant donor availability.
Diagnosis: Primary biliary cirrhosis.
Impairment Rating: 40% at time of confirmed diagnosis; progression to class 4 impairment when put on liver transplant waiting list.
Comment: Primary biliary cirrhosis is a relentlessly progressive liver disease that leads to class 4 impairment. Orthotopic liver transplantation offers significant benefit and should be considered early. Currently, the majority of recipients report a remarkable improvement in quality of life and many enjoy normal lifestyles, although compliance with drug therapies and follow-up visits are required. A successful transplant may ultimately reduce the impairment of the whole person.12,13

10% to 24% Impairment Due to Zirconium Chloride Burn and Leukoderma

Subject: 30-year-old man.
History: At work splashed with concentrated liquid zirconium chloride over face, scalp, and neck.
Despite immediate irrigation, hospitalized for 2 days for chemical burn. Healing and epithelialization occurred without complications; returned to work 22 days after episode. Months later, depigmentation occurred.
Current Symptoms: Depigmented areas sunburn easily, with considerable discomfort, restricting ability to work. Contact with heat (eg, hot showers, extremely warm days, or work as kiln operator) cause marked stinging sensation within affected skin areas, requiring cessation of all activities for 10 to 15 minutes until pain subsides.
Occasional muscle twitching and severe discomfort occur within the affected areas, waking individual from sleep once or twice a week.
Experiences considerable embarrassment when attempting to explain disfigurement; avoids some social activities previously participated in.

Physical Exam: Pigment loss, hyperesthesia, and intolerance to sunlight and warmth. Well-
demarcated areas of depigmentation with borders of hyperpigmentation, surrounding right side of the face (behind right ear to center of face, from midtemple area of scalp to chin, and on left side of neck and behind right ear). Maximum dimensions of depigmented areas on right side of face 16 x 11 cm. Neurologic examination: all depigmented areas hypersensitive to cold, heat, pinprick, and touch.
Clinical Studies: Basic labs: normal.
Diagnosis: Zirconium chloride burn and leukoderma with residual skin dysfunction.
Impairment Rating: 20% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Percentage of cutaneous impairment reflects decreased ability to perform some activities of daily living. Frequent occurrence of intense signs and symptoms, which precludes the performance of various activities, merits a rating at the upper end of class 2 impairment. If effective medical treatment were available to reduce frequency and intensity of signs and symptoms, estimated impairment percentage could be reduced. Behavioral changes exhibited by individual should be evaluated according to the criteria described in the Guides Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders; any psychiatric impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) would be combined with the skin impairment to determine whole person impairment.

16% to 25% Impairment Due to Acromegaly


Subject: 57-year-old man.
History: After treatment of a growth hormone– secreting tumor, headaches were relieved, but symptoms of fatigue, excess perspiration, and joint discomfort continued. Despite an attempt at surgical excision and ionizing radiation therapy, growth hormone (GH) level remained elevated at 4400 pmol/L (100 ng/mL) and individual unable to tolerate bromocriptine therapy. Testosterone level was low, but thyroid and adrenal function remained normal. Libido improved with bimonthly injections of testosterone; carpal tunnel syndrome required surgical therapy.
Current Symptoms: Pain in knees and back; decreased libido.


Physical Exam: Clinical hyperhidrosis; carpal tunnel syndrome; enlargement of hands, feet, and nose.
Clinical Studies: Enlarged sella turcica with suprasellar extension of a pituitary tumor. No visual field abnormalities. GH level: 25 300 pmol/L (575 ng/mL)—markedly elevated.
Diagnosis: Moderately severe acromegaly, inadequately controlled by therapy.
Impairment Rating: 16% impairment due to acromegaly and 5% impairment due to testosterone deficiency combine to 19% impairment
of the whole person (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).

16% to 25% Impairment Due to Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Disease

Subject: 26-year-old woman.
History: Following a delivery complicated by excessive blood loss and hypotension, failed to lactate; was not seen again until 6 months later.
Current Symptoms: Failure to resume menstrual cyclicity; progressively worsening fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss.
Physical Exam: Blood pressure (BP): 90/60 mm Hg; pulse rate (PR): 100 BPM. Sparse pubic and axillary hair; cool, dry skin; slow return of Achilles’ deep tendon reflexes; visual fields: normal.
Clinical Studies: Prolactin and thyrotropin (TSH) levels: low and unresponsive to 500 µg intravenous protirelin (TRH). Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH): unresponsive to administration of luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH). Attenuated response of cortisol to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and growth hormone unresponsive. Serum free thyroxine: low—7.7 pmol/L (0.6 ng/dL); TSH not elevated—0.2 µIU/L (0.2 µU/mL).
Diagnosis: Postpartum pituitary apoplexy (Sheehan’s syndrome) with panhypopituitarism.
Impairment Rating: 20% impairment due to panhypopituitarism; 10% impairment due to replacement for multiple hormones; combine (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to obtain whole person impairment.

Comment: Panhypopituitarism will remain permanent, requiring lifelong hormone replacement. With levothyroxine, hydrocortisone, and dehydroepiandrosterone replacement, normal adrenal and thyroid balance are established, but additional hydrocortisone is required at physiologically stressful times. The individual remains infertile and unable to lactate. Growth hormone replacement requires daily injections of very expensive human growth hormone. Fertility may be induced by hormonal stimulation of the ovary, but this is not always successful.

Example 10-4
26% to 50% Impairment Due to Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Disease

Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Seen initially at age 45 because of an enlarged sella turcica. Evaluation revealed testosterone deficiency; no suprasellar extension of the tumor. Individual was not treated; was lost to follow-up. Several years later, hospitalized with complaints of excruciating headache, visual loss, and impotence. Underwent emergency transsphenoidal pituitary decompression under coverage with glucocorticoids. Vision was unchanged, and mild headaches persisted. Unable to tolerate bromocriptine. Despite testosterone administration, continued to have erectile dysfunction.
Physical Exam: Beard markedly diminished; had a female escutcheon. Testing of visual fields showed nearly complete loss of vision in left eye and temporal field defect in right eye with
macular involvement. After decompression, visual acuity in left eye limited to finger counting; temporal field loss in right eye remained.


Clinical Studies: Skull roentgenogram: massively enlarged sella turcica. CT scan: extensive suprasellar growth of the tumor, with a suggestion of hemorrhage into the tumor. Preoperative prolactin concentration: 1000 µg/L (1000 ng/mL); postoperative prolactin level: remained elevated at 660 µg/L (660 ng/mL). In postoperative period, received course of ionizing radiation to the sella turcica. Subsequent evaluation revealed elevated prolactin concentration of 280 µg/L (280 ng/mL), low testosterone concentration, deficient cortisol response to hypoglycemia, and decreased thyroid function.
Diagnosis: Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma with pituitary apoplexy, secondary panhypopituitarism, and vision loss.
Impairment Rating: 26% impairment due to pituitary dysfunction, secondary adrenal dysfunction, and secondary testosterone deficiency; combine with impairments from loss of visual acuity and from persistent headaches (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine whole person impairment.
Comment: Regular monitoring and lifelong medication required.

16% to 25% Impairment Due to Hypothyroidism


Subject: 65-year-old man.
History: Severe hypothyroidism of 16 months’ duration, with pronounced mental slowing, loss of memory, and apathy. Also had severe coronary artery disease with angina pectoris that could be precipitated by walking only 50 ft. Repeated trials and careful adjustment of doses of levothyroxine indicated that a dose larger than 0.05 mg/d caused aggravation of the angina. Significant debility due to hypothyroidism persisted.
Current Symptoms: Angina; persistent fatigue; inability to maintain concentration; constipation.
Physical Exam: BP: 105/70 mm Hg. Dry skin; slowed reflexes.
Clinical Studies: Total thyroxine level: 6.4 nmol/L (0.5 mcg/dL). Thyrotropin level: 100 µIU/L (100 mIU/mL).


Diagnosis: Partially treated hypothyroidism.
Impairment Rating: 20% impairment due to hypothyroidism; combine with an appropriate value for the cardiovascular impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine whole person impairment.
Comment: If the cardiovascular disease were treated, for instance, by angioplasty or bypass surgery, it might be possible to fully replace the thyroid hormone level, in which case the impairment rating would need to be reevaluated.

15% to 29% Impairment Due to Hyperparathyroidism


Subject: 76-year-old woman.
History: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with inhaled bronchodilators and sporadic use of systemic glucocorticoids; was noted to have a serum calcium level of 3.05 mmol/L (12.2 mg/dL).
Current Symptoms: Mild anorexia, nocturia three times, and lethargy, in addition to respiratory distress symptoms of COPD.
Physical Exam: Physical signs of poor respiratory air exchange with sporadic wheezes. No palpable neck mass.
Clinical Studies: Serum calcium: 3.10 mmol/L (12.4 mg/dL); phosphorus: 0.67 mmol/L (2.1 mg/dL); PTH by IRMA: elevated—165 pg/mL; urinary calcium excretion: 380 mg/24 h.
Sestamibi scanning and MRI suggested presence of a retroesophageal parathyroid adenoma.
Diagnosis: Primary hyperparathyroidism due to an ectopic location of a parathyroid adenoma.


Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Due to the comorbid state of COPD, intrathoracic surgery was felt to carry too great a risk. Therefore, medical treatment consisting of adequate hydration and exercise, as well as avoidance of prolonged immobilization, use of diuretics, and calcium ingestion in excess of 800 mg per day was advised.

15% to 29% Impairment Due to Hypoadrenalism


Subject: 68-year-old woman.
History: 20-year history of Addison’s disease and 5year history of diverticulosis. During treatment of frequent episodes of diverticulitis, her glucocorticoid dose requires adjustment due to the accompanying state of relative adrenal insufficiency.
Current Symptoms: 3 days of progressively worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain, with fever to 38.4°C (101°F); accompanied by weakness, malaise, nausea, and vomiting.
Physical Exam: Marked tenderness in left lower quadrant of the abdomen, without rebound. BP: 110/70 mm Hg with PR 86 BPM when supine; 95/55 mm Hg and 108 BPM when erect. Mucous membranes dry.


Clinical Studies: Serum sodium: 126 mmol/L (126 mEq/L); potassium: 5.2 mmol/L (5.2 mEq/L); BUN: 10.7 mmol/L (30 mg/dL); Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (WSR): 64 mm/h; white blood cell count: 15 000 103/µL), with predominance of neutrophilic leukocytes. All symptoms, physical signs, and metabolic abnormalities of adrenal insufficiency abated with her maintaining fludrocortisone dosage at 0.1 mg per day and increasing hydrocortisone dosage to 90 mg per day, which was later decreased to her usual dosage as the diverticulitis responded to treatment.
Diagnosis: Addison’s disease with intercurrent febrile illness.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Continuing to take her daily adrenal hormone replacement. There were minimal effects on this individual’s ability to perform activities of daily living. However, these frequent episodes of an intercurrent illness illustrate the degree of adrenal insufficiency with its increase in morbidity and possibly mortality.

0% to 14% Impairment Due to Hyperadrenocorticism

Subject: 30-year-old woman.
History: Unremarkable other than the delivery of two children, who are now 6 and 4 years old.
Current Symptoms: 2 years of progressive weakness, easy bruisability, hirsutism, facial acne, weight gain, and depression.
Physical Exam: BP: 160/95 mm Hg; PR: 68 BPM. Marked central obesity with moderate peripheral muscle wasting and notable proximal muscle weakness. Rounded and acne-covered face. Red striae present over buttocks, flanks, and lower abdomen, bilaterally. Mildly increased vellus hair growth on face and lower arms; dark terminal hair on upper chest and upper abdomen.

Clinical Studies: Diurnal variation of cortisol secretion was lost as suggested by plasma cortisol concentrations: 690 nmol/L (25 µg/dL) and 607 nmol/L (22 µg/dL) at 8 AM and 4 PM, respectively. Urinary free cortisol excretion: elevated—966 nmol/d (350 µg/24 h); plasma corticotropin (ACTH): unmeasurable. Plasma cortisol and urinary free cortisol excretion failed to suppress during standard 2-day suppression tests, utilizing 2and 8-mg dexamethasone doses. CT scan of the abdomen: a 3-cm tumor in left adrenal gland.
With proper preoperative preparation, left adrenal gland was removed by open flank incision.
Glucocorticoid replacement, followed by tapering doses over 6 months, resulted in complete resolution of the hyperadrenal state.
Diagnosis: Cushing’s syndrome due to adrenocortical tumor.
Impairment Rating: 0% impairment of the whole person after resolution of clinical symptoms and signs.
Comment: Since the surgical cure rate for adrenal adenoma is virtually 100%, this individual should be considered cured.

0% to 14% Impairment Due to Hyperadrenocorticism


Subject: 21-year-old woman.
History: Unremarkable past medical history.
Current Symptoms: Since puberty, at age 13, persistent acne and progressive hirsutism, with irregular menstrual cyclicity. Feels self-conscious and depressed regarding her physical appearance and has difficulty socializing.
Physical Exam: BP: 120/80 mm Hg; PR: 80 BPM. Height: 167.6 cm (5 ft 6 in); weight: 72 kg (160 lb), which is diffusely distributed. Markedly increased dark terminal hairs on lower back, upper chest including periareolar, upper and lower abdomen, and upper thighs; dark vellus hairs on face and lower arms. No striae or purpura. No evidence of muscular weakness.


Clinical Studies: Plasma DHEA-S: elevated—108.0 µmol/L (4000 µg/mL); free testosterone: 12.2 pg/mL; normal levels of estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and cortisol, which suppresses following administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone.
Plasma: slightly elevated level (120 µg/dL) of 17?-hydroxyprogesterone had an exaggerated
response (12.0 nmol/L [400 ng/dL]) to administration of cosyntropin. Administration of 12 mg of prednisone every other day has resulted in normalization of the biochemical parameters, resolution of the acne, and marked diminution of the hirsutism, but not complete remission. Menstrual cyclicity returned to normal.
Diagnosis: Adult-onset 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Impairment Rating: 14% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The hirsutism may never completely resolve, leaving individual’s self-image and ability to socialize in a compromised state. Assess severity in chapter on mental and behavioral disorders (Chapter 14).

15% to 39% Impairment Due to Hyperadrenocorticism


Subject: 54-year-old man.
History: Transsphenoidal microadenomectomy 2 years ago as treatment for Cushing’s disease.
Current Symptoms: Past 6 months, 9.0-kg (20-lb) weight gain, acne, ankle edema, proximal muscle weakness, and generalized fatigue.
Physical Exam: BP: 150/100 mm Hg; PR: 84 BPM. Central obesity with rounded plethoric facies; red striae on abdomen and flanks; prominent proximal muscle weakness.
Clinical Studies: Serum sodium: 148 mmol/L (148 mEq/L); potassium: 2.8 mmol/L (2.8 mEq/L; BUN: 5.0 mmol/L (14 mg/dL). Plasma corticotropin (ACTH): elevated—33 pmol/L (150 pg/mL); urinary free cortisol: elevated—828 nmol/d (300 µg/24 h). Plasma cortisol at 8 AM: 552 nmol/L (20 µg/dL); at 4 PM: 607 nmol/L (22 µg/dL). Whereas there was no suppression of plasma cortisol and urinary free cortisol excretion with low-dose dexamethasone, there was adequate suppression with high-dose dexamethasone. MRI of the pituitary failed to reveal the presence of an adenoma, but CT scanning of the abdomen demonstrated bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. The individual was treated with 4500 rad of conventional megavoltage radiation to the pituitary gland, in addition to 4 g of mitotane daily and prednisone as replacement therapy.
Diagnosis: Recurrent Cushing’s disease.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person.


Comment: Radiation therapy was used to spare the individual a surgical procedure and the possibility of developing Nelson’s syndrome. Mitotane, as an adrenolytic agent, was used to achieve immediate control of the hypercortisolism since it may take up to 18 months to achieve maximum benefit from the radiation. Common complaints with the use of mitotane are nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. If signs and symptoms resolve, impairment rating may decrease.

Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Alarming personality changes during a period of a few weeks; had a seizure. A diagnosis of insulinoma was made. Experienced no impairment of hepatic function, and recovery from surgery was uneventful except for persistence of mild fasting hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia responded well to frequent feedings of a high-protein,
high-carbohydrate diet and 40 mg of prednisone, taken daily. Still had occasional transient mental lapses 10 months after returning to work, during one of which the plasma glucose level was 1.5 mmol/L (28 mg/dL). When daily dosage of prednisone was increased to 60 mg, symptomatic hypoglycemia improved, but manifestations of Cushing’s syndrome became more prominent.
Curent Symptoms: Episodes of irritability; lightheadedness; anxiety; diaphoresis.
Physical Exam: Physical central obesity; mild facial acne; 1+ bipedal edema; firm, palpable right upper quadrant mass.
Clinical Studies: Laparotomy: a large islet cell adenocarcinoma in the tail of the pancreas, with metastases in the liver. The spleen and the main tumor mass were resected.
Diagnosis: Metastatic islet cell adenocarcinoma with incomplete control of symptoms.
Impairment Rating: 50% impairment due to pancreatic malignant neoplasm and hypoglycemia and 10% impairment due to steroid-induced Cushing’s syndrome; because they involve different parts of the endocrine system, combine to give 55% impairment of the whole person (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).

 Gonads
In addition to producing sex hormones that affect male and female physical and sexual development and behavior, the gonads produce either spermatozoa or ova. The major hormone of the testes is testosterone, whereas those of the ovaries are estrogen
and progesterone. Dysfunction of the gonads can be caused by tumors, trauma, infection, chemotherapy, irradiation, autoimmune disease, abnormal XY chromatin, and surgical removal. Gonadal function may also vary with disorders of the pituitaryhypothalamic axis.

Subject: 58-year-old woman.
History: Following removal of an impacted upper left third molar, individual developed a left oroantral fistula and acute left maxillary sinusitis, confirmed by x-ray. Dental films confirmed a tooth remnant in the maxillary area. Despite use of antibiotics, she developed persistent drainage from the fistula and pain in the left maxillary area of the face. Severe pain was noted in the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and she experienced

progressive loss of mobility of the mandible, with the ability to open the jaws limited to a 1-cm excursion. The left oro-antral fistula was explored surgically 6 weeks later, and the residual tooth fragment was removed. A left naso-antral window was placed in the inferior meatus for drainage of the maxillary sinus. Extensive scarring in and about the left TMJ was found. The scars were released, but full mobility of the mandible was not obtained until the left coronoid process was released from the surrounding tissues. She received postoperative steroid therapy; physical therapy exercises maintained mandibular mobility. A stent to keep the jaws apart was created and used for several months while individual was sleeping.
Current Symptoms: On a soft diet because of discomfort in the left TMJ.

Does not smoke or drink. Had direct laryngoscopy and biopsy, flexible bronchoscopy, and rigid esophagoscopy.
Current Symptoms: Hoarseness; voice fatigue; pain. Unable to sing or speak extensively. Weak, strained voice. Unable to project voice.
Physical Exam: Gastroesophageal reflux disease, height disparity of vocal folds, and white, irregular, firm, vocal fold mass on laryngeal exam by strobovideolaryngoscopy.
Clinical Studies: Laryngeal electromyogram: left superior laryngeal nerve paresis with 50% decreased recruitment response and left recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis with 30% decreased recruitment, both from vocalis and posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. Objective voice measures: mild acoustic abnormalities including increased mean flow rate and decreased maximum phonation time. Laryngeal CT scan: normal cricoarytenoid joint and no focal lesions. Normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with gadolinium of larynx.
Diagnosis: Infiltrating keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of left vocal fold with evidence of focal chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Lesion was classified T2 N0 M0. Has undergone radiation therapy, reflux treatment, and voice therapy.
Impairment Rating: 15% to 34% voice/speech impairment; 5% to 12% impairment of the whole person.


Comment: May not be able to continue as a voice teacher and singer, with subsequent loss of income and life alteration. Will have to make frequent visits to physician for cancer surveillance, probably for life. Motor vehicle collision probably caused hemorrhage into previously asymptomatic cancerous tumor. Reflux was the only known risk factor in this nonsmoker. Voice became worse after surgery and radiation therapy.

Halting speech pattern. Short phrasing. Can only count up to “eight” on one breath. Has left facial weakness, dysphagia, and chronic cough.
Bilateral vocal fold immobility with patent but narrow airway on strobovideolaryngoscopy.
Clinical Studies: Laryngeal electromyogram: bilateral vocal fold paralysis. Severely short phonation times. All acoustic measures: highly abnormal.
Diagnosis: Bilateral vocal fold paralysis.
Impairment Rating: 60% to 84% impairment due to bilateral vocal fold paralysis; 21% to 30% whole person impairment. Combine with appropriate ratings due to other impairments to determine whole person impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Comment: Underwent voice therapy. Conservative, anterior vocal fold medializations. Cannot be heard in office setting or anywhere with background noise. Is dysfluent and has halting speech (often interpreted by others as intellectual deficits). Unable to use the telephone. Unable to carry on sustained conversation. Unlikely to ever regain voice he had prior to motor vehicle collision. Requires ongoing medical care (not only for voice) and will require multiple laryngeal surgical procedures for voice improvement. Is prone to aspiration pneumonia secondary to vocal fold paralysis. Requires ongoing voice therapy and voice-assistive devices.

60% to 84% Voice/Speech Impairment

Subject: 42-year-old woman.
History: Taught elementary school 7 years previously. Experienced sudden onset of hoarseness 1 month after starting teaching. Continued to teach for several months with hoarseness before
seeking medical attention. Otolaryngologist diagnosed vocal fold nodules and recommended resting voice for 4 days. She complied, but with no improvement in voice. Saw speech therapist weekly for 2 years with minimal voice improvement. Underwent excision of bilateral vocal fold masses. Voice improved until 6 months later, when recurrent hoarseness developed. Had recurrent vocal fold masses. Diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Had surgery after aggressive medical treatment for reflux disease and after voice therapy. No improvement in appearance of vocal fold lesions. Had excisional biopsy for definitive pathology.
Current Symptoms: Constant hoarseness and voice fatigue. Unable to project voice well and unable to sing. Year-round allergy symptoms.
Physical Exam: Moderately hoarse and breathy voice. Broad-based, solid, white mass of right vocal fold and fibrotic mass of left vocal fold on strobovideolaryngoscopy. Arytenoid erythema and edema consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease, bilateral superior surface varicosities, and scars on stroboscopy. No neuromuscular junction abnormalities were noted.
Clinical Studies: Laryngeal electromyogram: mild bilateral superior laryngeal nerve paresis.
Decreased intensity, phonation time, harmonic to noise ratio, acoustic measures, and S/Z ratio.
Diagnosis: Adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis.
Impairment Rating: 60% to 84% voice/speech impairment; 21% to 30% impairment of the whole person.

Comment: Required two subsequent laryngeal surgeries in attempt to eradicate disease and improve phonatory function. Requires ongoing surveillance by laryngologist for recurrence of papillomas and surveillance for development of laryngeal carcinoma. Requires ongoing voice therapy and treatment for reflux disease. Will require personal amplification system to help with vocal projection for job. Vocal prognosis is guarded.

85% to 100% Voice/Speech Impairment


Subject: 38-year-old man.
History: Worked with rubber, plastics, and chemicals for 20 years (described as responsible for “everything that blows up”). Suffered inhalation injury from heavy exposure to vinyl chloride fumes due to reactor malfunction. Had microlaryngoscopy and excision of bilateral vocal fold polyps 1 year after inhalation injury. Voice improved after surgery; remained off work for 6 weeks after operation. Exposed to ammonia fumes 1 month after returning to work.
Experienced immediate dyspnea and sudden and severe hoarseness. Required a second microlaryngoscopy and vocal fold polypectomy. Became aphonic after 3 days back at work. Required two vocal fold surgeries since initial injury.
Undergoing psychological counseling for stressrelated problems secondary to voice problems. Quit smoking.


Current Symptoms: Voice deterioration after using voice and after any exposure to fumes, perfume, smoke, or gasoline; hoarseness associated with shortness of breath; chronic sensation of lump in throat.
Physical Exam: Voice is harsh, hoarse, slightly breathy, and strained. Bilateral vocal fold scarring, decreased mucosal wave, hypervascularity, and mucosal irregularities on strobovideolaryngoscopy.
Clinical Studies: Marked abnormalities in harmonic to noise ratio, shimmer, and maximum flow rate.
Diagnosis: Mucosal vocal fold injury secondary to inhalation of noxious fumes, initially vinyl chloride. Airway hyperactivity that causes dysphonia and dyspnea.
Impairment Rating: 85% to 100% voice/speech impairment; 30% to 35% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Third surgery is recommended. Vocal fold mucosa and voice quality have never returned to normal. Had progressive dysplastic vocal fold changes (leukoplakia) 5 years later. Would be rated class 3 on basis of audibility if in an environment (such as home) protected from fumes or pollution. However, in activities of daily living, has a class 5 impairment.

15% Impairment Due to Visual Acuity Loss
Subject: 18-year-old man.
History: Driving instructor questioned student’s visual acuity. Student always liked to sit in front of the class to see the blackboard.
Current Symptoms: Has difficulty with distant road signs.
Physical Exam: No ocular abnormalities.
Clinical Studies: Best-corrected acuities: VOU: 20/40, VOD: 20/40, VOS: 20/40.

Visual fields are normal in both eyes; no other deficits in visual functions.

Functional Acuity Score (use Table 12-2 to determine the Visual Acuity Score for each eye; use Table 12-3 to combine the values to a Functional Acuity Score):
Functional Acuity Score	=	425/5 = 85
Diagnosis: Unexplained amblyopia, possibly congenital.
Impairment Rating: 100 – 85 = 15% visual impairment.

Comment: This rating places the person in the range of near-normal vision or mild vision loss. Persons in this range can generally function normally, but they need to bring reading material close.
---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 12-2
16% Impairment Due to Visual Acuity Loss


Subject: 45-year-old woman.
History: Office worker; left eye was enucleated in childhood.
Current Symptoms: Can perform all office functions.
Physical Exam: Left eye replaced by goodfitting prosthesis.
Clinical Studies: Best-corrected acuities: VOU: 20/15, VOD: 20/15, VOS: NLP.
Functional Acuity Score (use Tables 12-2 and 12-3, as above):
VOU  20/15	105 ? 3 =	315
VOD  20/15	105 ? 1 =	105
VOS	NLP	0 ? 1 =	 0
Functional Acuity Score	=	420/5 = 84
Diagnosis: History of retinoblastoma.
Impairment Rating: 100 – 84 = 16% visual impairment.
Comment: Based on visual acuity, this person’s condition is in the near-normal range. The visual field in the left eye is also lost (see Section 12.3). However, because this loss is not independent of the visual acuity loss (see the previous section) and does not exceed the visual acuity–based loss, the Functional Vision Score will still be equal to the Functional Acuity Score (see Example 12-12).
---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 12-3
25% Impairment Due to Visual Acuity Loss
Subject: 35-year-old man.
History: Farm worker; scratched the left eye on a branch several years ago.
Current Symptoms: Farm work is OK; no interest in reading or fine crafts.
Physical Exam: Dense corneal scar in OS.
Clinical Studies: Best-corrected acuities: VOU: 20/40, VOD: 20/40, VOS: 20/400.
Functional Acuity Score (use Tables 12-2 and 12-3, as above):
Functional Acuity Score	=	375/5 = 75
Diagnosis: Vision loss due to corneal opacity.
Impairment Rating: 100 – 75 = 25% visual impairment.
Comment: Even though the left eye has much poorer vision than in Example 12-1, this person is still in the range of near-normal vision or mild vision loss. Note that the impairment rating is influenced much more by binocular function than by the function of the lesser eye.

Example 12-4
36% Impairment Due to Visual Acuity Loss
Subject: 70-year-old woman.
History: Noticed gradual vision loss over several years. Afraid of surgery.
Current Symptoms: Increasing difficulties with reading.
Physical Exam: Early lens opacity OD; dense cataract OS.
Clinical Studies: Best-corrected acuities: VOU: 20/60, VOD: 20/60, VOS: 20/800.
Functional Acuity Score (use Tables 12-2 and 12-3, as above):
Functional Acuity Score	= 320/5 = 64

Diagnosis: Vision loss due to cataract.
Impairment Rating: 100 – 64 = 36% visual impairment.
Comment: Although 20/60 is still in the near-normal range, the very poor condition of the other eye drops the person to the range of moderate vision loss. Persons in this range can perform activities of daily living but may require some aids, such as a hand-held magnifier, to perform detail-oriented tasks, such as reading. If the VOU were not available, assume the VOU = VOD and proceed as above.

52% Impairment Due to Visual Acuity Loss


Subject: 25-year-old woman.
History: College student; vision loss since teens.
Current Symptoms: Relies on talking books and videomagnifier for her studies.
Physical Exam: Irregular foveal reflex OU.
Clinical Studies: Best-corrected acuities: VOU: 20/200, VOD: 20/300, VOS: 20/200.
Functional Acuity Score (use Tables 12-2 and 12-3, as above):

Functional Acuity Score	=	240/5 = 48
Diagnosis: Stargardt juvenile maculopathy.
Impairment Rating: 100 – 48 = 52% visual impairment.
Comment: This person is in the range of severe vision loss (sometimes called legal blindness in the United States) and will have limitations in the ability to perform activities of daily living even with aids. Persons in this range need to rely more heavily on assistive devices.
---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 12-7
18% Impairment Due to Visual Field Loss

Request: Determine the Visual Field Score for an individual with a midperipheral ring scotoma due to early RP. The central field is not affected. The Goldmann III4e isopter is as indicated.
Method 1: Determine the peripheral field limits and the peripheral subscore as in Example 12-6.
(For simplicity, the peripheral score is kept the same.)
Determine the extent of the scotoma in each of the sample meridians.
Subtract the amounts indicated in Table 12-8. The Visual Field Score is 90.


Method 2: Using the overlay grid as in Example
12-6, do not count the 18 points within the scotoma.
Comment: The Visual Field Score is reduced by 18 points from 100 to 82 (18% impairment). This places the individual in the near-normal range.
Because the scotoma is in the midperiphery, central vision is not affected and far peripheral vision still warns of obstacles. Thus, the effect on daily living skills is relatively minor. The effect on the whole person depends on the exact condition of the other eye.
---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 12-8
20% Impairment Due to Visual Field Loss

This individual has a juxtafoveal scotoma due to early macular degeneration. Letter chart acuity is still unaffected.
Request: Determine the Visual Field Score.
Method 1: Subtract points from each meridian as indicated in Figure 12-6.
100 – 20 = 80 (20% impairment).


Method 2: Subtract the solid dots that are not seen (see Figure 12-7).
100 – 20 = 80 (20% impairment).
Comment: Although this scotoma is far smaller than the one in the previous example, it will significantly interfere with reading and similar tasks.
This justifies a significant decrease of the Functional Field Score and a corresponding increase in the impairment rating. (See also Examples 12-13 and 12-14.)
---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 12-9
72% Impairment Due to Visual Field Loss


A Goldmann visual field test is not available for this individual. Automated static perimetry has been performed with the result indicated in Figure 12-8.


Follow these steps:
1. Construct a pseudoisopter around the points with better than 10-dB sensitivity.
2. Measure the extent in the 10 meridians. If this is a Humphrey 30-2 plot, the test points are 6° apart. The subscores are shown in Figure 12-9.


The Visual Field Score is 28. The field-related impairment rating is 100 – 28 = 72.

Comment: This may be a case of advanced retinitis pigmentosa. The automated field test did not test points beyond 30° from fixation. The calculated Visual Field Score is acceptable only if there is additional evidence that there is no further peripheral vision. A full-field automated test is preferred. In the absence of such a test and in advanced cases like this one, evidence from a confrontation visual field may be acceptable.

---START EXAMPLE---
Example 12-10
2% Impairment With Consideration of Binocular Visual Field Loss

An individual has a nasal defect in the left eye. The right eye is normal (see Figure 12-10).
Visual Field Score: Visual Field Score, using the overlay grid (100 – solid dots missed + open dots seen).
OS: 100 – 24 + 3 =	79
OU: 100 –  2 + 7 = 105 ? 3 = 315
OD:	100
494 / 5 = 99
(1% impairment rating)
Comment: Because the defect in the left eye corresponds to a seeing area of the right eye, the scotoma is not counted in the binocular plot. Because the binocular field carries 60% of the weight of the Functional Field Score, the Functional Field Score is affected little.
---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 12-11
4% Impairment With Consideration of Binocular Visual Field Loss

An individual has a temporal defect in the left eye (see Figure 12-11).
Visual Field Score: Visual Field Score, using the overlay grid (100 – solid dots missed + open dots seen).
OS: 100 – 20 =	80
OU: 100 – 4 + 4 = 100 ? 3 = 300
OD:	100
380 / 5 = 96
(4% impairment rating)
Comment: Because the temporal defect in the left eye extends beyond the area seen by the right eye, both the left eye score and the binocular score are affected. Thus, the Functional Field Score is affected more than in Example 12-10.
---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 12-13
16% Impairment Due to Perifoveal Visual Field Loss

Subject: 65-year-old man.
History: No prior history of eye disease.
Current Symptoms: Reading is no longer enjoyable.
Physical Exam: Atrophic macular degeneration (geographic atrophy).
Clinical Studies: Best-corrected acuities: VOU: 20/20, VOD: 20/20, and VOS: 20/20.
Visual field studies reveal a central island of good foveal vision surrounded by a scotoma; beyond this scotoma the peripheral field is normal.

Functional Acuity Score: Normal visual acuity means Functional Acuity Score = 100.
Functional Field Score: The grid points at 3° and 5° are missed in all 10 meridians (20 points lost). The Visual Field Score is 100 – 10 ? 2 = 80.
Functional Vision Score: Because the field loss does not include the center of fixation, the rule for central scotomata does not apply. The Functional Vision Score is
FAS ? FFS/100 ? 100 ? 80/100 = 80.
Diagnosis: Age-related maculopathy.
Impairment Rating: 100 – 80 = 20% impairment of the visual system, which is also the impairment of the whole person (see Table 12-10).
Comment: The impairment rating reflects the significant effect of a perifoveal scotoma on reading ability and other daily living skills. Without the perifoveal scotoma, the impairment would have been 0%.

Example 12-14
45% Impairment Due to Visual Acuity Loss Combined With Visual Field Loss

Subject: 68-year-old man described in Example 12-13.
History: Prior history of macular degeneration.
Current Symptoms: Has lost the central island of his vision. Reading is possible only with a strong magnifier.
Physical Exam: Progressive macular degeneration, now including the foveal area.
Clinical Studies:
Functional Acuity Score: Visual acuity dropped to 20/160. The Visual Acuity Score, considered alone, is 20/160 = 55 (45% impairment rating).
Functional Field Score: All grid points at 1°, 3°, and 5° are lost. The Visual Field Score, considered alone, is 100 – 10 ? 3 = 70 (30% impairment rating).
Functional Vision Score: Because the field loss now includes the center of fixation, the rule for central scotomata applies. For the calculation of the Functional Vision Score, the central field loss of 30% is ignored because it does not exceed the 45% visual acuity loss. Therefore, the Functional Field Score is entered into the calculation as if it were 100. The calculation is: FAS ? FFS/100 ? 55 ? 100/100 = 55.
Diagnosis: Progressive age-related maculopathy.


Impairment Rating: 100 – 55 = 45% impairment of the visual system, which is also the impairment of the whole person (see Table 12-10).
Comment: In Example 12-13, the impairment rating was determined by the visual field loss. In this case, the visual acuity loss dominates.

Example12-15
59% Impairment Due to Visual Acuity Loss Combined With Visual Field Loss

Subject: 75-year-old man described in Examples 12-13 and 12-14.
History: Prior history of macular degeneration. In recent years the individual has also been followed for glaucoma.
Current Symptoms: Reading remains possible with a strong magnifier, but the individual complains of being startled by objects in his peripheral vision.
Physical Exam: The macular degeneration appears stationary. The optic disc shows cupping.
Clinical Studies:
Functional Acuity Score: The Visual Acuity Score is still 20/160 = 55 (45% impairment rating).
Functional Field Score: In addition to the 30 central points, 25 peripheral points are now lost. The Visual Field Score, considered alone, is 100 – 30 (central loss) – 25 = 45 (55% impairment rating).
Functional Vision Score: Although the visual field loss alone (55%) is worse than the visual acuity loss alone (45%), for the calculation of the Functional Vision Score the central field loss is ignored since this part of the vision loss is already accounted for in the visual acuity impairment rating (see Table 12-9 and the example above). The peripheral field loss, which is independent of the visual acuity loss, is not ignored. Therefore, the Functional Field Score is now entered into the calculation as if it were 100 – 25 = 75. Therefore: FVS = FAS ? FFS/100 ? 55 ? 75/100 = 41 (59%
impairment rating).
Diagnosis: Age-related maculopathy. Chronic openangle glaucoma.
Impairment Rating: 100 – 41 = 59% impairment of the visual system, which might be rated as 56% impairment of the whole person (see Table 12-10).
Comment: The impairment rating is now affected by the visual acuity loss as well as by the peripheral field loss.

0% to 14% Impairment Due to Parkinsonian Syndrome With Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension

Subject: 70-year-old man.
History: Right-handed; periodic episodes of suddenonset drop attacks for the past 3 years. Paralysis agitans (Parkinson’s disease) for the past 10 years; under treatment with appropriate medications.
Current Symptoms: Postural hypotension, dizziness, light-headedness with a resting tremor.
Physical Exam: BP: 140/90 mm Hg seated, 100/74 mm Hg standing, with minimal increase in pulse

rate. Classic features of Parkinson’s syndrome: flat facies, resting tremor and hesitant speech, cogwheeling, festinating gait and propulsion, and mild orofacial dyskinesia.
Clinical Studies: MRI: nonspecific mild widening of cortical sulci.
Diagnosis: Parkinsonian syndrome with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.
Impairment Rating: 14% impairment due to drop attacks; combine with appropriate rating from movement Section 13.5 to determine whole person impairment (see Combined Values Chart,
p. 604).
Comment: Despite many attempts to adjust medications to control both sets of symptoms, the individual has some dependence on his caregivers to prevent serious falls, limiting his ability to perform independently all activities of daily living.

15% to 39% Impairment Due to Uremic Encephalopathy and Uremic Neuropathy

Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Right-handed; 10-year history of progressive kidney failure, leading to thrice-weekly renal dialysis. Repeated episodes of lapse of concentration and alteration of awareness, as well as uremic encephalopathy, for the past 3 years.
Current Symptoms: Periodic episodes of forgetfulness, disorientation, apathy, wandering between dialysis treatments. Burning numb sensations in his feet.
Physical Exam: BP: 140/90 mm Hg; disheveled appearance, disoriented to time, person, and place; poor performance for three-word retention, spelling of world backward, serial 7s, and understanding of proverbs. Diminished strength 4/5 distally in both lower legs, with poor deep-tendon reflexes and decreased response to pin, cold, and vibration distally, and painful dysesthesias upon squeezing the soles of his feet.
Clinical Studies: EEG: poorly developed 8to 13Hz alpha activity with a preponderance of 4to 7Hz theta activity diffusely. CT scan: normal.
Blood studies: elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and calcium, and lowered phosphorus.
Diagnosis: Uremic encephalopathy with episodes of confusion and uremic neuropathy.
Impairment Rating: 30% impairment due to dialysis dementia, confusion, and uremic neuropathy; combine with appropriate ratings due to kidney disease and peripheral neuropathy to determine whole person impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Comment: The most limiting symptom of the renal failure is the individual’s periodic state of altered mentation and awareness, with a baseline dementia. This moderately interferes with his ability to perform activities of daily living in addition to the moderate limitations due to his peripheral neuropathy, which is mild, and his renal failure and periodic dialysis treatments.

15% to 29% Impairment Due to Partial Epilepsy
Subject: 40-year-old man.
History: Left-handed mechanic; at age 30 was involved in a motor vehicle accident with significant head trauma. Unconscious and hospitalized for 3 weeks; recovered, with rehabilitation, with no neurologic impairment on examination over the course of a year. Subsequently took training

and completed courses in motor mechanical repairs, but started having focal seizures with brief lapse of consciousness 5 years ago, occurring about twice a week until partially and intermittently controlled on medications.
Current Symptoms: Over the past year has taken his medication without fail with numerous attempts at modification by his neurologist.
Continues to have brief episodes of left arm/hand weakness, lasting about 3 minutes, about once a month, resulting in limited activities at work and inability to drive.
Physical Exam: Normal vital signs and general physical examination. No cognitive or communication impairments; cranial nerve functions are normal. Mild weakness of dominant left hand, with poor dexterity in fine movements and strength 4/5. Deep-tendon reflexes are increased at the biceps area on the left; poor finger-nose fine dexterity.
Clinical Studies: EEG: periodic delta slowing in the right temporal-parietal area. MRI: old area of small infarction in the right posterior temporalparietal region.
Diagnosis: Partial epilepsy without mention of impairment of consciousness.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person due to seizures; combine with appropriate rating due to neurologic impairments to determine whole person impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Comment: Seizures developed after apparent cerebral contusion as seen in the MRI and EEG, with persistent neurologic signs of impairment in his dominant hand. Seizures have not been controlled, and individual continues to have brief partial seizures in addition to hand impairment. The latter should be combined in the whole person evaluations using the guidelines given in Chapter 16, The Upper Extremities.

15% to 29% Impairment Due to Partial Epilepsy

Subject: 22-year-old man.
History: Suffered blunt trauma to the right side of the head during a robbery attempt in the store at which he works. Admitted in status epilepticus, but control was rapidly established with intravenous phenytoin.
Current Symptoms: Maintained on phenytoin without further overt seizures, but he has frequent auras with derealization during which time he ceases activity. These episodes occur 0 to 8 times per day, last 5 to 10 minutes, and are followed by full recovery and resumption of activity.

Physical Exam: Normal neurologic evaluation.
Clinical Studies: MRI: left temporal lucency; EEG: left temporal rare spikes.
Diagnosis: Partial epilepsy without mention of impairment of consciousness.
Impairment Rating: 29% impairment of the whole person due to seizures.

30% to 49% Impairment Due to Episodic Loss of Consciousness

Subject: 65-year-old man.
History: Right-handed; blunt head trauma with a skull fracture during a robbery 3 years ago.
Decompressive surgery was followed by mild left hemiplegia, which improved with rehabilitation. Episodes of syncope for the past 5 years.
Current Symptoms: Episodes of syncope, at times followed by brief increase in left hemiplegia.
Physical Examination: BP: 170/96 mm Hg seated, 130/70 mm Hg upon standing, without compensatory tachycardia. Moderate left hemiplegia, which improves over the next 30 minutes to baseline mild left hemiplegia.
Clinical Studies: MRI of head: contusion of the right parietal area; EEG: slowing in the same region.


Diagnosis: Syncope and collapse, transient cerebral ischemia, late effect intracranial injury, and cerebral contusion.
Impairment Rating: 45% impairment due to above diagnosis; combine with an appropriate rating due to the hemiparesis to determine whole person impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Comment: With the drop in blood pressure, there was a decrease in cerebral perfusion with brief decompensation of the previous neurologic impairment and subsequent return to baseline. This is not really a transient ischemic attack (TIA), but rather transient cerebral ischemia (TCI) secondary to decreased cerebral perfusion into a previously damaged area.

30% to 49% Impairment Due to Traumatic Brain Injury

Subject: 25-year-old man.
History: Right-handed; 1 year ago was involved in a head-on collision of the car he was driving with another automobile, which had crossed the highway median. Did not have his seat belt on, and did

not recall hitting his head on the steering wheel and windshield. Brought to the hospital unconscious; had sustained a fracture of the left arm. Over the next 4 weeks, gradually improved with rehabilitation; had no recall of the accident or immediate preceding events.
Current Symptoms: Moderate inability to follow commands and find his room. Disoriented to time, person, and place; wanders alone and gets lost in familiar surroundings. Loss of interest in home activities and current events. Sleep-wake cycle has been interrupted. Decreased ability to initiate responses, agitation, learning difficulties, impulsivity, and social disinhibition.
Physical Exam: No focal or lateral paralysis, but attention and gait are slow. The latter is not grossly ataxic, and Romberg sign is negative. Cranial nerve functions are intact. Mental status examination reveals 18/30 with poor orientation; difficulty with recall of three unrelated words and spelling world backward. No motor or sensory difficulties, and cerebellar testing is adequate.

Examples of neurologic conditions associated with changes in emotion and affect include (1) right hemisphere infarct and inappropriate jocularity; (2) left hemisphere infarct and deep dejection and dysphasia;
(3) left-sided temporolimbic seizure foci and ideational disorders; and (4) right-sided temporolimbic seizure foci and mood disturbances. With the more diffuse pathology underlying the dementias, “no cognitive” behavioral symptoms (apathy, delusions, dysphoria, agitation/aggression, euphoria, hallucinations, irritability/lability, and aberrant motor behavior) may be assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).14 This tool was evaluated for content and concurrent validity, has good test-retest reliability, and has good internal consistency among the items of the NPI.

3% Impairment Due to Olfactory Tract Damage


Subject: 24-year-old man.
History: Right-handed; individual had a car accident without a seat belt 4 months ago and sustained a severe whiplash and subsequently struck his forehead on the windshield, with brief loss of consciousness.
Current Symptoms: Intermittent dizziness and headaches, but individual is more bothered by loss of smell and diminished appetite secondary to lack of taste.
Physical Exam: Normal except for 10/40 on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, which is compatible with anosmia.
Clinical Studies: CT scan, MRI, and EEG: normal.
Diagnosis: Olfactory tract damage.
Impairment Rating: 3% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: It is important to remember not to use an irritant when testing smell, since this will stimulate trigeminal nerve endings and not reflect olfactory function. Appropriate bedside odorants include coffee, flowers, and some foods.

10% Visual Acuity Impairment Due to Unilateral Optic Neuritis

Subject: 27-year-old woman.
History: Right-handed; enjoyed good health with accurate vision until 6 months ago, when she developed a painless progressive vision loss in the left eye. During the subsequent 6 months, visual clarity returned slightly.

Current Symptoms: Vision is blurred when she tries to read the newspaper with the affected eye; she has not been able to see television images clearly with this eye. She can perform all ADL functions with the unaffected eye.
Physical Exam: Near and far visual acuity of the left eye is 20/200; right eye, 20/20; binocular, 20/20. The eyes are externally normal; ophthalmoscopy reveals moderate pallor of the left optic disk. The pupil of the left eye is slightly dilated and poorly reactive to a direct light stimulus. No reaction in the right eye to left eye stimulation. When the right eye is stimulated with bright light, there is prompt constriction of the pupil of the left eye.
No other cranial nerve signs.
Clinical Studies: Visual evoked potentials: prolongation of the P100 in the left eye.
Diagnosis: Optic neuritis, left eye.
Impairment Rating: 10% impairment of the whole person based on Table 13-9 and a left eye acuity of 20/200.


Comment: Although this case represents a 50% visual acuity loss in the left eye, the impairment rating is much lower, since the ability to perform ADL depends largely on the better eye. If the right eye had the same loss, the impairment rating would be much worse.

25% Vision Impairment Due to Sixth Nerve Palsy, With Concurrent Peripheral Neuropathy

Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Right-handed; 4-month history of seeing objects double, especially when looking to the right. He has also complained of burning, pinsand-needles sensation in his feet, mainly at night.
Current Symptoms: Persistent double vision on looking to the right interferes with performing some ADL. Burning sensation in his feet prevents him from obtaining a good night’s sleep.
Physical Exam: Double vision is present on forward fixation and worsens upon looking to the right side. Poor abduction of the right eye on looking into the right lateral field. Decreased distal perception to pinprick and cold in both feet, with hyperesthesias of the soles of his feet to compression.
Clinical Studies: Showed type 2 diabetes mellitus, moderately controlled.
Diagnosis: Sixth nerve palsy and peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus.
Impairment Rating: Chapter 12 has no specific scale for diplopia. This individual can still read normal print but has reduced reading endurance and no reserve for small print. He is in the range of near-normal vision (see Table 12-2), which warrants an impairment rating of up to 25%.
Comment: Combine the visual impairment from any impairment due to his peripheral neuropathy.

15% to 24% Impairment Due to Trigeminal Neuralgia
Subject: 60-year-old woman.
History: Right-handed; 3-month history of brief, sudden attacks of right-sided facial pain that radiates from the jaw to the mouth and up to the ear. These have occurred in the past with long remissions but now are more frequent.
Current Symptoms: Chewing, smiling, or hot or cold fluid touching the lower canine tooth triggers attacks of pain. Pain is described as a very severe, sudden, brief, electricity-like shock followed by severe pain. When the pain clears, she has no pain in her face until the next recurrence. No symptoms between these sudden brief episodes.

Physical Exam: Normal, without demonstrable sensory impairment. Light stimulation of upper lip reproduces lightning-like painful sensations similar to her history (trigger point).
Clinical Studies: None unless neurologic impairment is documented.
Diagnosis: Trigeminal neuralgia.
Impairment Rating: 15% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Pain may respond to carbamazepine and/or Lioresal, but these medications may not be tolerated in the elderly. Surgical intervention, such as stereotactic thermocoagulation of the gasserian ganglion, may be required, but this may leave the face unpleasantly numb. In this case, the uncontrolled facial neuralgic pain interferes with daily, social, and interpersonal activities.

25% to 35% Impairment Due to Postherpetic Neuralgia
Subject: 70-year-old woman.
History: Left-handed; episode of herpes zoster rash in left V1 distribution.
Current Symptoms: Severe, nonstop burning and itching in this area. She cannot comb her hair or wash this area since touching makes it worse.
Physical Exam: White scars of herpes eruption and diminished discrimination of pain and light touch over the left upper face.
Clinical Studies: None.
Diagnosis: Postherpetic neuralgia.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person.


13.4e Cranial Nerve VII—the Facial Nerve The facial nerve is a nerve with both motor and sensory components. The motor part innervates the facial muscles of expression and accessory muscles for chewing and swallowing. The sensory fibers carry tactile sensations from a part of the external auditory canal, ear, tympanic membrane, soft palate and adjacent pharynx, and taste to the anterior two thirds of the tongue. Special fibers innervate the lacrimal and salivary glands.

Sensory loss related to facial nerve impairment does not interfere with activities of daily living. Loss of taste usually is not considered to be a major impairment. See Table 13-12 for impairment criteria.
Unilateral motor impairment poses a risk of vision impairment because of blinking loss and corneal injury. Eating and speaking also can be affected.

5% to 19% Impairment Due to Bell’s Palsy

Subject: 40-year-old woman.
History: Right-handed; 4 months ago, individual developed a “numbness sensation” of the forehead and right side of the face over the course of 2 to 3 days. She also noted drooling from the right side of her mouth when drinking coffee and occasionally bit the right side of her tongue.
Current Symptoms: Total loss of movement of the right side of the face with persistent elevation of the right eyelid without voluntary control of closure. Increased sensitivity to sound in the right ear.
Physical Exam: Mild to moderate loss of motility of the forehead on the right and complete loss of motility of the lower right side of the face and eyelid elevation. No reportable perception of vinegar on the right side of the tongue. No other cranial nerve or long tract signs. Congestion of the conjunctiva of the right eye and apparent irritation.
Clinical Studies: Electromyogram (EMG) of the facial muscle may be considered.
Diagnosis: Bell’s palsy, unilateral.
Impairment Rating: 19% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Corticosteroids may be considered in the first days of Bell’s palsy to shorten the course.
Most but not all affected individuals lose taste on the anterior two thirds of the tongue. The major problem is to protect the cornea from drying, since the eyelid does not close spontaneously or voluntarily. EMG may be helpful when consideration for innervation is under way.

15% to 39% Impairment Due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Subject: 45-year-old man.
History: Right-handed; individual has developed progressive weakness of the hands and legs with wasting of the musculature over the past 6 months.
Current Symptoms: Choking and frequent coughing during meals. Difficulty swallowing, with occasional nasal regurgitation of fluids and choking during meals. Voice has become hoarse and difficult to understand. He has lost 9.0 kg (20 lb).
Physical Exam: Severe wasting of the musculature of both hands; however, he can lift his arms and legs against gravity with difficulty. He was drooling from his mouth with a tenacious saliva, which he caught in a handkerchief. Speech was soft with poor articulation, and tongue showed wormlike fasciculations. He also had fasciculations of the hands, arms, and thighs. The deep-tendon reflexes were diminished in the arms and increased at the knee with up-going toes. No sensory impairments.
Clinical Studies: EMG: evidence of denervation by fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and increased insertional activity in all limbs. Neuroimaging and swallowing studies may be appropriate.
Diagnosis: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Impairment Rating: 39% impairment due to swallowing disorder associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; combine with appropriate ratings due to other neurologic impairments to determine whole person impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Comment: The most disturbing and potentially dangerous symptom of this terrible condition is the individual’s inability to control his secretions, putting him at risk for aspiration.

40% to 60% Impairment Due to Nondominant-Side Hemiplegia and Hemianopia

Subject: 65-year-old woman.
History: Right-handed; 4 months ago, this hypertensive diabetic woman developed transient episodes of weakness and numbness of the left side of her face, arm, and leg, which progressed to a complete loss of motility and sensation on the left side.
Current Symptoms: Left-sided weakness, with inability to move the left arm or leg and loss of some movement of the left lower face. Difficulty controlling fluids, with frequent nasal regurgitation and aspiration, particularly of liquids or semisolids. Bedridden and requires assistance in all activities of daily living.
Physical Exam: Flaccid left hemiplegia; unable to elevate left arm or leg. Mild to moderate weakness of the left lower face, with drooling.
Frequent choking and nasal regurgitation with liquids and semisolids. Confrontation fields show a dense left homonymous hemianopia. Decreased sensation to pin, cold, and vibration of the left arm and leg. Up-going toe on the left.
Clinical Studies: CT scan: large intracranial hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia thalamic area.
Swallowing studies: unable to control secretions and aspiration of the dye.
Diagnosis: Late effect of CVA with nondominant side hemiplegia and hemianopia.
Impairment Rating: 60% impairment due to inablility to swallow or handle oral secretions without choking due to nondominant-side hemiplegia; combine with appropriate ratings for other neurologic impairments to determine whole person impairment (see Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Comment: This severe CVA has not improved and has left this woman completely dependent on others, bedridden, with frequent aspirations of her meals and medications.

13.7
Criteria for
Rating Spinal Cord and Related
	Impairments
The spinal cord conveys nerve impulses for motor, sensory, and visceral functions. Disorders of impulse transmission can result in permanent impairment.
The magnitude of the impairment is estimated according to the effects on the ability to perform activities of daily living and the results of neurologic examination and testing. See Chapter 15, The Spine, for spine impairment rating by neurologic level of involvement.

25% to 39% Impairment Due to Posttraumatic Neuralgia of the Superficial Radial Nerve

Subject: 45-year-old man.
History: Right-handed; developed burning pain in the distribution of the right superficial radial nerve following a routine venipuncture. Use of a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit provided some relief.
Current Symptoms: Pain increases with attempts to grip or pinch the right hand. Pain is limited
to the distribution of the superficial radial nerve. Difficulty using the right hand for bathing, dressing, combing hair, and writing.
Physical Exam: Right hand is cold, edematous, with trophic changes and hyperesthesia over the radial distribution.
Diagnosis: Posttraumatic neuralgia of the superficial radial nerve secondary to injury.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Because of its location, damage to the superficial radial nerve occurs from glass, knives, power saws, and surgeries, especially de Quervain’s tenosynovectomy. This condition can be so severe that some ADL are not possible.

Example 13-45
40% to 60% Impairment Due to Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy

Subject: 30-year-old woman.
History: Right-handed; right carpal tunnel release 1 year ago. While recovering from the surgery, she developed diffuse burning pain in the hand, extending to the forearm, accompanied by

swelling of the right hand. Several stellate ganglion blocks temporarily relieved the pain and reduced the swelling. Over time, she noted color changes and increased sweating; the hand was always cold, and movement of the fingers and wrist was limited. A TENS unit was used constantly, along with medication, to control the pain.
Current Symptoms: Deep burning pain, increased sweating, right arm weakness, and inability to use the hand for any daily activities.
Physical Exam: Right arm held close to the body in a protected fashion. The hand is dusky with a sweaty palm, and the skin is thinned. Fingers are tightly adducted and cannot be separated.
Attempts to move the wrist produce allodynia (occurrence of pain from a painless stimulus, eg, touch). Proximal muscles have poor tone and disuse atrophy.
Clinical Studies: Three-phase bone scan: unremarkable; plain radiograph: diffuse demineralization.
Diagnosis: Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD).
Impairment Rating: 40% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: RSD does not have a preexisting psychological substrate; sufferers may become anxious and depressed because of failed therapies.

5% Impairment Due to Mononeuropathy in the Lower Extremity

Subject: 60-year-old woman.
History: Individual has diabetes mellitus; developed a persistent and painful numbness of the right lower extremity over a 6-month period.
Current Symptoms: Dysesthesias involve the lateral aspect of the lower leg and extend in a more severe fashion down to the dorsum of the foot.
Physical Exam: Decreased perception of pinpoint, cold, and light touch on the dorsum of the foot extending to the upper lateral calf area; painful paresthesias and dysesthesias of the foot; and mild weakness of dorsiflexion of the foot with a mild foot drop, characteristic of a peroneal nerve neuropathy. Able to ambulate without a cane.
Clinical Studies: Nerve conduction studies: abnormal right peroneal nerve indicated focal slowing of the motor conduction velocity across the head of the fibula.

Diagnosis: Mononeuropathy of the peroneal nerve secondary to diabetes mellitus.
Impairment Rating: 5% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Method used to arrive at impairment rating:
  Loss of function due to motor involvement of the common peroneal nerve (strength): Maximum motor loss in the peroneal nerve is 15% whole person impairment (Table 17-37) ? 25% motor deficit, grade 4 (Table 13-24) = 4% whole person impairment.
  Loss of function due to sensory involvement of common peroneal nerve: 25% representing sensory loss (Table 13-23) ? 2% representing sensory function of common peroneal nerve (Table 17-37) = 0.5%, or 1% whole person impairment (rounded).
  A 4% whole person impairment combined with a 1% whole person impairment is a 5% whole person impairment (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).

Example 13-47
31% Impairment Due to Sensorimotor Polyneuropathy

Subject: 35-year-old man.
History: Prolonged episode of severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, followed by onset of intense paresthesias, burning pain, and muscle tenderness.
Current Symptoms: Paresthesias in extremities with weakness in the feet and—less so—in the hands. Gait is unsteady
Physical Exam: Weakness more profound distally than proximally in the limb. Reflexes diminished in the upper extremities and difficult to obtain at the knees and ankles. Sensory examination intact for pin but diminished for vibration and joint position in the feet and hands. Mees’ lines in the fingernails and toenails; desquamating brown rash on the palms and soles.
Clinical Studies: Nerve conduction studies 2 months after the onset of symptoms: no motor or sensory responses. Needle EMG: spontaneous activity (denervation potentials) in the distal muscles with impaired recruitment. Pancytopenia with basophilic stippling of the red blood cells. Elevated arsenic levels present in the hair and nails.
Diagnosis: Arsenic neuropathy involving motor and sensory fibers.

Impairment Rating: 31% impairment due to sensorimotor polyneuropathy; combine with appropriate ratings due to other neurologic impairments to determine whole person impairment. See method used to arrive at impairment rating below.
Comment: The presentation of a distal dying-back neuropathy, as in this case of arsenic neuropathy, is typical of the majority of toxic neuropathies. Removal from exposure is associated with improvement of findings in the peripheral nervous system, but the amount of recovery is related to the severity of the initial insult. As in this case, significant distal weakness in the intrinsic muscles of the hands and feet and moderate weakness in the dorsiflexors and plantar flexors were present 1 year later. Diminished vibration in a stocking-glove distribution and position sense continued to interfere with gait and the performance of dexterous activities with the hands. The individual complained of ongoing dysesthesia in the soles and cramping in the calves. Before rating an impairment following neurotoxic exposure, adequate time must pass to allow for recovery to a relatively stable plateau.

20% to 23% Impairment Due to Fracture With Greater Than 50% Compression of Vertebrae

Subject: 54-year-old woman.
History: Fell from a ladder and sustained a burst fracture of L2 with a 55% loss of height, without neurologic findings. Treated with bracing, the fracture healed; returned to most ADL 6 months after the injury.
Current Symptoms: No neurologic complaints, but has back pain after heavy activity or with weather changes.
Physical Exam: Mild tenderness to palpation at the fracture site. Neurologic examination and SLR: negative. Range of motion is mildly decreased.
Clinical Studies: Radiograph: fracture healed with 60% loss of height.
Diagnosis: Burst fracture L2 > 50%.
Impairment Rating: 20% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Individual qualifies for lumbar DRE category IV based on the fracture. Neurologic deficit, if present, would warrant category V or Section 15.7. If she had multiple compression fractures in the same or different spinal regions, use the ROM method for rating.

25% to 28% Impairment Due to Radiculopathy and Alteration of Motion Segment Integrity

Subject: 25-year-old man.
History: Onset of back and left leg pain after a fall on a concrete surface while carrying a box.
Initially presented with muscle spasm, an SLR on the left side at 60°, a positive crossed SLR at 70°, and an absent left Achilles tendon reflex. Treated with physical therapy but did not improve.
Underwent surgical diskectomy and arthrodesis of L5-S1 3 months after the injury. After 9 months of rehabilitation, leg and back symptoms were diminished but persistent.
Current Symptoms: Back and thigh pain at rest and persistent numbness along the lateral side of the foot 1 year after the onset of symptoms. Pain and numbness prevent individual from maintaining a constant position, prolonged standing or walking, or performing his prior work, recreational, and some household activities.
Physical Exam: Severely restricted range of motion. Loss of the Achilles reflex. Numbness in the S1 nerve root distribution and dermatomal pain in the leg on SLR.
Clinical Studies: Original MRI: a severely degenerated L5-S1 disk with a herniation on the left side. Postoperative MRI with gadolinium: fibrosis, but no residual or recurrent herniation. Fusion appears solid.
Diagnosis: Left posterolateral disk herniation L5-S1 with S1 radiculopathy and severe disk degeneration, unresolved status postdiskectomy and L5-S1 fusion.
Impairment Rating: 28% impairment of the whole person.


Comment: Symptoms, physical findings, and imaging studies are all consistent with a symptomatic herniated disk. Excision of the offending disk and a single-level fusion did not relieve all symptoms, which are supported by signs of a persistent radiculopathy. Individual qualifies for lumbar DRE category V because he has persistent radiculopathy as well as single-level alteration of motion segment integrity.

20% to 23% Impairment Due to Compression Fracture of T1

Subject: 56-year-old-man.
History: Truck driver in motor vehicle accident was unconscious and had a seizure. Improved with physical therapy. Able to drive again and do usual ADL. No further seizures; off medication.
Current Symptoms: Bilateral upper extremity heaviness and weakness.
Physical Exam: Numbness over T1 distribution bilaterally; weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles.
Clinical Studies: 65% compression fracture of T1.
Diagnosis: Compression fracture of T1 with bilateral radiculopathy. New onset seizure disorder.

25% to 28% Impairment Due to Radiculopathy and Alteration of Motion Segment Integrity

Subject: 35-year-old man.
History: Individual fell from the second floor of a building on which he was working and sustained a compression fracture of T8. He had minor right lower extremity weakness and numbness. After anterior surgical decompression and instrumented fusion from T7 through T9 he improved and was able to return to most ADL and walk without braces or crutches, but he still had weakness and patchy numbness in the right lower extremity.
Current Symptoms: Minor pain on heavy activity.
Physical Exam: Neurologically, spotty numbness in the right lower extremity with 4/5 weakness and mild atrophy of the right thigh and leg muscles. Right lower extremity reflexes are slightly hyperactive.
Clinical Studies: MRI: compression fracture T8 without canal compromise. Radiograph: treated fracture with fusion.
Diagnosis: Compression fracture T8 treated surgically with mild residual right lower extremity neurologic involvement.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person by DRE method; another option is to use the ROM method.
Comment: This individual qualifies for DRE thoracic category V because he has mild right lower extremity neurologic deficits (category III) and alteration of motion segment integrity given the fusion (category IV). A combination of categories III and IV in the thoracic region means that the individual qualifies for category V. Because he has alteration of motion segment integrity of more than one level (multilevel fusion), he could also be rated by the ROM method. The best approach would be to rate the individual by both methods and award the higher rating.

69% Impairment Due to Compression Fracture With Corticospinal Tract Damage

Subject: 28-year-old man.
History: Sustained a C6 vertebral body fracture with almost 40% compression after a fall from a scaffold. Had loss of bladder control and weakness of both lower extremities. He also had numbness and


weakness of both upper extremities, which was verified as a C7-level radiculopathy by positive sharp waves on the electromyogram in three arm muscles 4 weeks after the injury. Underwent corpectomy of C6 and a fusion from C5 to C7.
Current Symptoms: Pain free with numbness and weakness of upper extremities; no remaining bladder symptoms. Unable to walk without leg braces (orthoses).
Physical Exam: Mild sensory changes from C7 distally. C6-innervated muscles function normally, but he had weakness of muscles innervated by C7 and lower nerve roots.
Clinical Studies: Neurodiagnostic studies: see above; radiographs show a solid fusion from C5 through C7.
Diagnosis: C6 compression fracture with corticospinal tract damage.

Impairment Rating: 69% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Although this man has a vertebral fracture, his corticospinal tract involvement indicates he should be rated using the neurology tables.
His numbness, weakness, and difficulty with dexterity movements of both upper extremities warrant a 39% WPI. He is unable to walk without braces, indicating a class 3 WPI of 39%. He has no bowel or bladder dysfunction. His vertebral fracture results in a DRE III, or 15% impairment. Combining 39%, 39%, and 15% WPI using the Combined Values Chart results in a 69% WPI.

78% Impairment Due to Burst Fracture With Cauda
Equina Syndrome

Subject: 54-year-old woman.
History: Fell from a ladder and sustained a burst fracture of L2 with a loss of height of 35%. In addition to numbness and weakness of both lower extremities, she was unable to empty her bladder and required catheterization. Following anterior decompression of the cauda equina and fusion from L1 to L3, the fractures healed, and she regained partial function in the muscles innervated by the L2 and lower nerve roots.
Current Symptoms: Persistent weakness of both lower extremities requiring the use of ankle-foot orthoses. Walks using two crutches. Requires intermittent catheterization of her bladder. She has occasional bowel incontinence.
Physical Exam: Mild tenderness to palpation at the fracture site. Neurologic examination reveals weakness of L2 to S1 innervated muscle and numbness and atrophy of both lower extremities. Decreased rectal tone. Knee and ankle reflexes are absent.
Clinical Studies: Repeat x-rays of the region: solid fusion from L1 to L3.
Diagnosis: Burst fracture L2 with cauda equina syndrome.
Impairment Rating: 78% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Her lower extremity weakness and use of orthoses and crutches indicate a class 3, or 39%, WPI. The bladder impairment, requiring intermittent catheterization, indicates a class 4, or 50%, WPI. Her rectal tone is deceased, with occasional bowel incontinence, indicating a class 2 anorectal impairment of 20%. The burst fracture
receives a DRE lumbar category III rating of 10%. Combining 50%, 39%, 20%, and 10% results in a combined whole person impairment of 78%.
15.8
Range-of-Motion
	Method
Although called the range-of-motion method, this evaluation method actually consists of three elements that need to be assessed: (1) the range of motion of the impaired spine region; (2) accompanying diagnoses (Table 15-7); and (3) any spinal nerve deficit, which is described in this chapter and in Chapter 13 (The Central and Peripheral Nervous System).
Mobility, diagnoses, and nerve root deficits all provide important clinical information about function of an individual’s spine.15-21 An impairment rating based on loss of motion is valid only if there is medical evidence of a documented injury or illness with a permanent anatomic and/or physiologic residual dysfunction. The whole person impairment rating is obtained by combining ratings from all three components, using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).

1% Impairment Due to Loss of Left Lateral Bending

Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Persisting back pain, worse over the last year; no specific injury identified.
Current Symptoms: Lumbar pain increases with standing or walking for more than 1 hour.

Figure 15-10 provides a measurement template for lumbar impairment evaluation using the ROM method.


* If ankylosis is present, combine the ankylosis impairment with the range-of-motion impairment (Combined Values Chart, p. 604).

If ankyloses in several planes are present, combine the ankylosis estimates (Combined Values Chart), then combine the result with the range-of-motion impairment.

15% Impairment Due to Limitation (Ankylosis)
of Lateral Bending

Subject: 40-year-old man.
History: Fell from a ladder, landed on his buttocks, and fractured L3 and L4 vertebrae with wedging toward the left side.
Current Symptoms: Low back pain after heavy lifting, with radiating pain to the knee.
Physical Exam: Leaning to the left; cannot straighten his back to a neutral position.
Clinical Studies: Inclinometric measurements show his starting position is at 20° of left lateral bending with further motion to 30°. The 20° is closest to the neutral position and is considered an ankylosis of 20° for rating purposes. Use the Ankylosis section of Table 15-9.
Diagnosis: Compression fractures of L3 and L4 with apex left lateral wedging.
Impairment Rating: 15% impairment of the whole person due to limitation (ankylosis) of lateral bending.
Comment: Add to this any impairments for other ROM deficits in the lumbar spine, then combine the total ROM impairment with those for the compression fractures (Table 15-7) and neurologic deficits, if any.

Example 15-21
5% Impairment Due to Ankylosing Spondylitis and Low Back Pain
Subject: 47-year-old man.
History: Ankylosing spondylitis.
Current Symptoms: Chronic low back pain.
Physical Examination: Attempts to extend his thoracic spine fully demonstrate an angle of minimum kyphosis of 60°. With maximum flexion, T1 readings of 35°, 45°, and 55° are recorded, which are matched with T12 flexion angles of 25°, 30°, and 40°, respectively. The angles of thoracic flexion, derived by subtracting the T12 from the T1 angles, are 10°, 15°, and 15°. These three measurements meet validity criteria.
Clinical Studies: Radiographs: consistent with ankylosing spondylitis.
Diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis and low back pain.
Impairment Rating: According to Table 15-10, the impairment due to a 60° ankylosis (angle of minimum kyphosis) is 5% whole person impairment. The maximum flexion of 15° is 2% whole person impairment. The total impairment is the greater of the ankylosis and abnormal motion percentages, in this instance, 5%.
Comment: Combine this with impairments from the diagnosis table (Table 15-7).
---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example: The left bending flexion angles measured from the calvarium are 20°, 35°, 35‚° and 40°. The
corresponding T1 measurements are 5°, 5°, 10°, and 10°. The true left lateral degrees of bending are 15°, 20°, 25°, and 30°. The 15° is discarded. The other three measurements fulfill the validation criteria, being more than 5° from the mean of 25°. The greatest left lateral bending angle of the three trials is 30°, and the impairment rating due to left lateral bending limitation is 1% (Table 15-13).


Ankylosis
1. Place both inclinometer bases against a desk or tabletop and adjust until they read 0°, or the neutral position.

2. Place one inclinometer in the frontal plane at T1 (Figure 15-16b) and the second inclinometer over the calvarium.

15.11c Cervical Rotation
Because the technique for cervical evaluation stabilizes the trunk in the supine position, with the shoulders on the table, only one inclinometer is required for measurement of rotation.
1. Provide information to the individual about the procedure, and allow for appropriate warm-up exercises. Set the inclinometer to 0° or the gravity position.
2. Have the individual lie supine on a flat exam table with shoulders exposed to permit observation of any truncal (thoracolumbar) rotation. Stand at the head of the table and place the inclinometer in the transverse plane with the base applied to the forehead (Figure 15-17a). Record the neutral 0° position with the individual’s nose pointing to the ceiling.
3. Ask the individual to rotate the head maximally to the left, and record the cervical left rotation angle.
4. Ask the individual to rotate the head maximally to the right, and record the cervical right rotation angle (Figure 15-17b).
5. Repeat the procedure three to six times to obtain a valid set of three consecutive measurements. The left and right cervical rotation angles should be within 5° or 10% of the mean of a valid set, whichever is greater. The impairment rating is based on the greatest angle of a valid set.

23% Impairment Due to Herniated Disk With Radiculopathy

Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Developed low back pain and right sciatica after lifting furniture at home. A herniated lumbar disk was treated surgically, with near complete relief of pain. About 15 months ago postoperatively, he reinjured his lumbar spine while lifting on the job. An MRI showed a recurrent herniated disk at the same level and side as before. He underwent a second diskectomy, but this time was unrelieved of pain.
Current Symptoms: Back and unilateral, radiating right leg pain, unchanged for many months.
Physical Exam: Healed scar on the back. Straight leg raising caused pain along the lateral leg and foot at 30°. The right Achilles reflex was absent. Numbness in the right S1 nerve root distribution range of motion and straight-leg-raising testing using the double-inclinometer technique resulted in the following measurements: true lumbar extension 20°; true lumbar flexion 30°; left lateral flexion 25°; right lateral flexion 20°.
The sensory changes in S1 nerve distribution were judged to be grade 4 according to Table 15-15, and weakness in the S1-innervated muscles was judged to be grade 4 according to Table 15-16.
Clinical Studies: MRI after the second injury: recurrent herniated disk. Repeat MRI with gadolinium after surgery and failure to improve: only perineural scarring. Repeat routine x-rays: slight disk space narrowing at the involved level.
Diagnosis: Recurrent herniated disk with radiculopathy.
Impairment Rating: 23% impairment of the whole person.

Comment: Individual has a 12% whole person impairment according to Table 15-7, 10% due to “surgically treated disk lesion with residual, medically documented pain and rigidity,” added to 2% for the second operation. He has an impairment of 2% impairment due to loss of lumbar extension and 4% due to loss of flexion, with at least 45° of sacral (hip) motion (Table 15-8) and 6% loss due to extension and flexion. He has 0% impairment due to loss of left lateral lumbar flexion, 1% loss of right lateral flexion (Table 15-9), and 1% loss of lateral movement. He therefore has 7% impairment due to loss of lumbar motion. From Table 15-15 we see that he has a grade 4 sensory loss of
S1. Multiplying 25% (the maximum percentage in this case) by the 5% for maximum loss of S1 sensation from Table 15-18 results in a rating of 1% due to sensory loss. We also see that he has a grade 4 motor loss according to Table 15-16.
Multiplying 25% (the maximum in this case) by the 20% from Table 15-18 for S1 motor loss results in 5% impairment due to motor loss of S1. Combining the 1% for sensory loss and the 5% for motor loss results in a 6% impairment due to neurologic loss. Using the Combined Values Chart to combine the impairment from Table
15-7, (12%) with the impairments due to loss of motion (7%) and neurologic involvement (6%) results in a whole person impairment of 23%. In some cases, the physician may be asked to apportion the findings. One approach is to subtract 10% from the latest impairment rating due to the first injury, assuming it was a DRE III without ROM data after the first operation and the radiculopathy had resolved after the first surgery.

7% Impairment Due to Ankylosing Spondylitis

Subject: 56-year-old man.
History: Individual with known ankylosing spondylitis has become unable to work because of pain and is considering retirement, depending on his impairment rating.
Current Symptoms: Moderate pain; cannot straighten up completely.
Physical Exam: Measurement of the motion and ankylosis in the thoracic spine demonstrates an angle of minimum kyphosis of 60°. With maximum flexion, T1 readings of 35°, 45°, and 55° are recorded, which are matched with T12 flexion angles of 25°, 30°, and 40°, respectively. The angles of thoracic flexion, which are derived by subtracting the T1 angles from the T12 angles, are 10°, 15°, and 15°. These meet validity criteria. T1
rotation to the right measures 15°, 20°, and 15°. Corresponding T12 rotation angles measure 5°, 10°, and 5°. The measurements are valid, and the left rotation angle is 10°. The right thoracic rotation angles are the same as the right.
Diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis.
Impairment Rating: 7% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: According to Table 15-10, the impairment due to ankylosis (angle of minimum kyphosis) of 60° is 5% of the whole person and, considering maximum flexion, the impairment due to abnormal motion of 15° is 2%. The total impairment is the greater of the ankylosis and abnormal motion percentages, in this instance, 5%. The impairment due to loss of right thoracic rotation is, according to Table 15-11, 1%.
Impairment due to loss of left thoracic rotation is the same. Adding these impairments results in a whole person impairment of 7%. Because there has been no injury or surgery, the individual does not meet any of the other diagnostic criteria in Table 15-7, and there is no neurologic involvement, the whole person impairment is derived solely from the loss of motion and is 7%. If there was loss of motion in any other spinal region, each region would be rated separately and the ratings combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).

23% Impairment Due to Compression Fractures


Subject: 54-year-old woman.
History: Fell from a ladder and sustained burst fractures of L2 with loss of height of 55% and L3 with loss of height of 20%. Treated with bracing and the fractures healed. Returned to work as a customer service agent 6 months after the injury.
Current Symptoms: No neurologic findings, but she has back pain after heavy activity.
Physical Exam: Mild tenderness to palpation at the fracture site. Neurologic examination is negative. Straight leg raising is negative. True lumbar extension is 10°, flexion is 30°, and left and right lateral bending are each 10°. There is normal hip motion.
Clinical Studies: Repeat x-rays of the area: healed fractures with persistent loss of height of greater than 50% at L2 and 20% at L3.
Diagnosis: Compression fractures L2 and L3.
Impairment Rating: 23% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Injuries at two vertebrae within the same region, with a 55% compression of L2, according to Table 15-7, results in an impairment of 7%. The compression fracture of L3 results in an impairment of 5%, according to Table 15-7. The instructions are to combine these two impairment ratings; doing so results in an impairment rating of 12%.
The woman has true lumbar extension of 10° which, according to Table 15-8, results in an impairment of 5%, a lumbar flexion of 30°, which results in an impairment of 4% (Table 15-8), and left and right lateral bending of 10°, which results in an impairment of 2% for each (Table 15-9).
Adding these four impairments due to loss of motion results in an impairment of 13%.
Combining the impairment of 12% from Table 15-7 and the 13% from Tables 15-8 and 15-9 results in a whole person impairment of 23%.

5% Impairment Due to Pelvic Stress Fracture


Subject: 22-year-old man.
History: Military intensive training involving running with a backpack of 40 lbs over extended time and distance. Difficulty standing up because of pain in the pelvis and in the right upper thigh.
Pain was enhanced by walking and running. Felt challenged not to report the pain, which he felt while jumping over a boulder 2 weeks prior to the time of the medical exam. The pain was intensified with further running.
Current Symptoms: Pain in the right groin and medial upper thigh aggravated by standing and walking; improved in the supine position.
Physical Exam: Acute tenderness to palpation and pressure on the right pubic bone and the right adductor and hamstrings origin at the inferior ischiopubic junction.
Clinical Studies: Pelvic x-rays: transverse fissure in the upper border of the obturator foramen; there is already a callus development in the area.
Diagnosis: Stress fracture at the right ischiopubic junction.
Impairment Rating: 5% whole person impairment due to delayed union with deformity and residual signs after achieving MMI.
Comment: The callus formation continued and grew, producing a delayed union. He continued to have right groin and medial upper thigh pain, increasing with walking and running, and stabilizing after 9 months. Stress fractures of the pelvis, especially of the inferior branch of the pubic bone, need to be investigated and treated in a timely manner. Delay in investigation and diagnosis may result in massive callus formation and abnormal union, as well as continued pain, especially with standing and running.

---START EXAMPLE---
Example 16-2

Exam: Amputation through the PIP joint of the index finger.
Analysis: A PIP joint amputation represents 80% finger impairment. The relative index finger value to the hand is 20%; therefore, this amputation represents 80% ? 20%, or 16% hand impairment (Table 16-1). The relative hand value to the upper extremity is 90%; 16% hand impairment corresponds to 16% ? 90%, or 14% upper extremity
impairment (Table 16-2).
Impairment Rating: The relative upper extremity value to the whole person is 60%; a 14% upper extremity impairment equals 14% ? 60%, or 8% whole person impairment (Table 16-3).

Impairment Rating for Digit Amputation
1. Determine the length of the digit remaining after amputation and evaluate the digit impairment according to Figure 16-4 for the thumb and Figure 16-5 for the fingers. Amputations through the metacarpal are considered to be 100% impairment of the finger. Amputations of the thumb through the first metacarpal receive additional consideration (see 4. below).
2. If a digit has more than one type of impairment (eg, sensory, motion, amputation), the total digit impairment rating is obtained by combining the various digit impairment ratings. The total digit impairment rating is then converted to a hand impairment (Table 16-1).
3.
When multiple digits are involved, the hand impairment values for each digit are added directly to obtain the total hand impairment. The total hand impairment is multiplied by 90% to obtain the upper extremity impairment (Table
16-2) and then by 60% to obtain impairment of the whole person (Table 16-3).
4. As shown on Table 16-4, thumb amputations proximal to the MP joint level are expressed in terms of impairment of the upper extremity and receive greater values (37% to 38%, according to level) than amputation of the thumb at the MP joint level (36%). When other hand impairments are present, the total hand impairment value is converted to impairment of the upper extremity and then added directly to the upper extremity impairment value resulting from amputation of the thumb ray.
5. Convert the hand impairment rating to the upper extremity and whole person impairment ratings (Tables 16-2 and 16-3).


---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 16-3

Exam: Thumb amputation through the proximal metaphysis of the proximal phalanx.
Analysis: According to Figure 16-4, a proximal metaphysis thumb amputation receives a 90% digit impairment rating. Since the relative value of the thumb to the hand is 40% (Figure 16-3 and Table 16-1), the thumb amputation converts to 36% hand impairment. Using Table 16-2, the
36% hand impairment converts to 32% upper extremity impairment.
Impairment Rating: According to Table 16-3, the 32% upper extremity impairment converts to 19% impairment of the whole person.


---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 16-4

Exam: Amputation of the thumb at the MP joint with amputation through the DIP joint of the index finger.
Analysis: Amputation of the thumb at the MP joint (100% ? 40% = 40% hand impairment) with amputation through the DIP joint of the index finger (45% ? 20% = 9% hand impairment) corre-
sponds to 40% + 9%, or 49% hand impairment. This is equivalent to 49% ? 90%, or 44% impairment of the upper extremity (Table 16-2).
Impairment Rating: The impairment of the whole person is 44% ? 60%, or 26% (Table 16-3).


---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 16-5

Exam: Thumb ray amputation at the CMC joint with amputation of the index finger at the MP joint.
Analysis: Thumb amputation at the CMC joint equals 38% impairment of the upper extremity (Table 16-4). Amputation of the index finger at the MP joint equals 20% hand impairment (Table 16-4 and Figure 16-3), or 18% impairment of the upper extremity (Table 16-2). The upper extremity impairment values of 38% for the thumb and 18% for the index finger are added directly together, or equal 56%.
Impairment Rating: A 56% impairment of the upper extremity converts to a 34% impairment of the whole person (Table 16-3).
16.2
d Conditions Associated With Amputation
Evaluation of the residual stump must assess the status of soft tissue coverage, of the peripheral nerve and vascular systems, and of the bone itself. Unstable soft tissue coverage or painful scars are evaluated according to Chapter 8, The Skin. Peripheral nerve problems, such as associated neuromas and complex regional pain syndromes, are assessed according to Section 16.5, Impairment of the Upper Extremities Due to Peripheral Nerve Disorders, or Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System. Phantom pain is of neurogenic or central origin and is discussed in Chapter 18, Pain. Impairments resulting from peripheral vascular disorders are evaluated according to Section 16.6; Chapter 4, The Cardiovascular System: Systemic and Pulmonary Arteries; or Chapter
13. Bone overgrowth rarely occurs in other than the long bones of juvenile amputees and receives special consideration according to the problems presented. Any impairment resulting from lost or restricted motion of proximal joints is evaluated according to Section 16.4, Evaluating Abnormal Motion.

Impairments related to any of the above associated conditions are rated separately in terms of upper extremity impairment and then combined with the total upper extremity impairment due to amputation.

Impairment Rating: Add contributing motion impairments: (8% + 8%) + (4% + 4%) = 24% impairment of the upper extremity.

Example 16-14
Exam: Wrist ankylosis 0° extension and 0° lateral deviation.
Analysis: Ankylosis impairments derived from pie charts:
IA% at 0° VFlex/Ext = 21% impairment of upper extremity (Figure 16-28).
IA% at 0° VRD/UD = 3% impairment of upper extremity (Figure 16-31).
Impairment Rating: Add contributing ankylosis impairments: Wrist motion impairment = 21% + 9% = 30% impairment of the upper extremity.

The actual ROM measurements are recorded and applied to the various impairment pie charts.
Impairment values for degree measurements falling between those listed may be adjusted or interpolated proportionally in the corresponding interval.

---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 16-16
Exam: Active wrist extension is measured at 30° in the involved extremity and at 50° in the contralateral, uninjured extremity (Figure 16-28).
Analysis: IE% at 30° VExt = 5% (involved wrist). IE% at 50° VExt = 2% (baseline wrist).
Impairment Rating: The upper extremity impairment value for the involved wrist is adjusted to 5% – 2% = 3%.


If an involved joint has “normal” motion according to the values specified in the Guides and the contralateral uninvolved joint has greater than average motion, there is a relative loss of motion. However, a loss of motion in a zone beyond the normal values does not as a rule represent a loss of function or impairment. In fact, with the exception of some specialized activities such as gymnastics or Eastern expressive dancing (hyperextension of digits and wrist), an overly flexible joint could be considered an impairment. For example, if the hyperlaxity resulted in subluxation or dislocation, it would be ratable in accordance with Table 16-22 or 16-26. In rare cases, based on the examiner’s clinical judgment, an impairment percent not to exceed 2% of the maximum regional impairment value of a unit of motion could be given. The rationale for this decision must be explained in the report.

Thumb Radial Abduction
Radial abduction is measured in degrees as the largest angle of separation actively formed between the first and second metacarpals in the coronal plane (Figure 16-16). The stationary arm of the goniometer is aligned over the second metacarpal, and the movable arm over the first metacarpal. The normal angle of radial abduction is 50°. Note that in full radial adduction, the smallest angle of separation is 15° due to anatomic configurations. The relative value of radial abduction is 10% of the thumb ray.

1. Measure and record the goniometer reading for maximum active radial abduction and radial adduction, or the angle of ankylosis.
2. Using Table 16-8a, match the measured angles of radial abduction to their corresponding impairments of radial abduction.
3. If the CMC joint is ankylosed, match the measured angle to its corresponding ankylosis impairment (Table 16-8a) to obtain the thumb impairment due to loss of this function.
4. Convert thumb impairment to hand impairment using Table 16-1.

Combining Abnormal Motion at More Than One Finger Joint
Method for individual joint measurements:
1. Determine the motion impairment of each joint in terms of finger impairment, as described in the preceding pages.
2. Combine the finger impairments derived for each joint to obtain the total finger impairment due to loss of motion (Combined Values Chart, p. 604). If all three joints are involved, combine the resulting impairment value from the first two joints to the value of the third joint.

Method for total active range-of-motion measurements:
1. Combine the IE% of all three joints.
2. Combine the IF% of all three joints.
3. Subtract the extension combined value from the flexion combined value to determine the finger impairment due to decreased motion.

Express the finger impairment in terms of the hand, upper extremity, and whole person impairment (Tables 16-1 through 16-3).

---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 16-33

Exam: Middle finger has a DIP joint impairment of 12%, PIP joint impairment of 31%, and MP joint impairment of 27%.
Analysis: 12% combined with 31% = 39% (Combined Values Chart, p. 604); 39% combined with 27% = 55% total middle finger motion impairment.
Impairment Rating: This is equivalent to an impairment of 11% of the hand (Table 16-1), 10% of the upper extremity (Table 16-2), and 6% of the whole person (Table 16-3).


16.4f Multiple Digit Impairments Combining Digit Amputation, Sensory Loss, and Abnormal Motion Impairments of
the Hand
1. Determine separately the digit impairments contributed by amputation, sensory loss, and abnormal motion.
2. Combine the digit impairment percents using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) to obtain the total digit impairment.
3.
Use Tables 16-1 through 16-3 to relate the digit impairment in succession to impairment of the hand, the upper extremity, and the whole person. If more than one digit is involved, the impairment values contributed by each digit are added to obtain the total hand impairment before making the conversion to upper extremity impairment.

---END EXAMPLE---
---START EXAMPLE---
Example 16-34


Exam: A middle finger amputation impairment of 20%, a sensory impairment of 10%, and an abnormal motion impairment of 10%.
Analysis: 20% combined with 10% = 28%; 28% combined with 10% = 35% middle finger impairment (Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Impairment Rating: This corresponds to 7% impairment of the hand (Table 16-1), 6% impairment of the upper extremity (Table 16-2), and 4% impairment of the whole person (Table 16-3).

---START EXAMPLE---
Example 16-35


Exam: Thumb has 30% amputation impairment, 10% sensory impairment, and 10% abnormal motion impairment.
Analysis: 30% combined with 10% = 37%; 37% combined with 10% = 43% thumb impairment (Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Impairment Rating: This corresponds to 17% impairment of the hand, 15% impairment of the upper extremity, and 9% impairment of the whole person (Tables 16-1, 16-2, and 16-3).

Determining Hand Impairment From Two or More Digits
1. If two or more digits are involved, calculate separately the total digit impairment for each.
2. Using Table 16-1, convert each digit impairment to a hand impairment value.
3. Add the hand impairment values contributed by each digit to obtain the total hand impairment.
4. In a hand presenting an upper extremity impairment from amputation of the thumb proximal to the MP joint, the hand impairment resulting from involvement of the other digits is converted to upper extremity impairment (Table 16-2) and then added directly to the upper extremity impairment value resulting from amputation of the thumb ray (Table 16-4).
5. Using Tables 16-2 and 16-3, the hand impairment is related to that of the upper extremity and the whole person.

Determining Impairment Due to Abnormal Wrist Motion
1. Using Figures 16-28 and 16-31, determine the impairment of the upper extremity contributed by each wrist unit of motion (flexion and extension, radial and ulnar deviation) by adding IF% + IE% and IRD% + IUD%.
2. Because the relative upper extremity value of each wrist functional unit has been taken into consideration in the impairment pie charts, the impairments contributed by each unit of motion are added directly to determine the impairment of the upper extremity due to abnormal wrist motion, or it equals (IF% + IE%) + (IRD% + IUD%).
3. If the wrist joint is ankylosed, add the ankylosis impairment contributed by each unit of motion to determine the upper extremity impairment due to loss of wrist motion.
4. Use Table 16-3 to relate the impairment of the upper extremity to impairment of the whole person.


---END EXAMPLE---

2.
Because the relative upper extremity value of each elbow functional unit has been taken into consideration in the impairment pie charts, the impairment values contributed by each unit of motion are added directly to determine the impairment of the upper extremity due to abnormal elbow motion, or it equals (IF% + IE%) + (IP% + IS%).
3. If the elbow joint is ankylosed, add the ankylosis impairments contributed by each unit of motion to determine the upper extremity impairment resulting from loss of elbow motion.

Example 16-65
Physical Exam: Passive radial deviation of the MP joint of the thumb of 60°, compared to 30° on the normal side.
Analysis: The difference in angulation of 30° is graded as severe and represents a 60% joint impairment (Table 16-23). The MP joint represents 15% of the thumb ray unit (Table 16-18).
Impairment Rating: The thumb impairment is 16% ? 15% = 9%; this is equivalent to 4% hand impairment (Table 16-1) and 4% upper extremity impairment (Table 16-2).


Wrist Elbow Joint Active Radial and Ulnar Deviations
Active radial or ulnar deviation of the wrist or elbow is measured in maximum active extension of the joint. The severity of lateral deviation is rated according to the excess number of angulation degrees compared to the normal opposite side (Table 16-24). The percentage of impairment is multiplied by the relative value of the joint (Table 16-18) to obtain the upper extremity impairment.

If the same joint presents other findings, the rules outlined on page 499 must be followed to avoid duplication of impairments.

History: Healed Bennett’s fracture.
Physical Exam: Individual complained of pain and weakness when he applied and removed strong alligator clamps. Full active range of motion of the thumb ray. Positive “grind” test at the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. Lateral (key) pinch was 6 kg on the injured side and 10 kg on the normal side.
Clinical Studies: Radiographs: irregularities of the CMC joint surfaces with arthritic changes.

Example 16-73


History: Table saw injury. Maximum medical rehabilitation reached.
Findings: Index finger: Amputation at DIP joint with painful neuroma on radial side that prevents use of the digit for most activities. Thumb: Amputation through CMC joint.
Analysis:
Index finger:
DIP joint amputation = 45% digit impairment (Table 16-5), or 9% hand impairment (Table 16-1) and 8% upper extremity impairment (Table 16-2).
Radial nerve neuroma: Grade 1 pain or sensory deficit = 95% deficit (Table 16-10a); maximum impairment of the upper extremity for deficit of radial palmar digital nerve of index finger = 5% (Table 16-15). 95% ? 5% = 5% (rounded) impairment of the upper extremity.
8% (amputation) combined with 5% (neuroma) equals 13% impairment of the upper extremity due to the index finger (See Section 16.4f and Combined Values Chart, p. 604).
Thumb:
Amputation at the CMC joint = 38% impairment of the upper extremity (Table 16-4).


Impairment Rating: 13% (index) + 38% (thumb) = 51% impairment of the upper extremity, or 31% impairment of the whole person (Table 16-3). See the rating method for thumb amputation proximal to the MP joint.

A primary flexor tenorrhaphy of the FDP and FDS tendons and a microneurorrhaphy of
the radial digital nerve were done, followed by a 3-month hand rehabilitation program.
Current Symptoms: Numbness on radial side of the middle finger, pain on flexion, and weakness of the right hand.

Findings and Analysis:
Sensory impairment:
9 mm of two-point discrimination on the radial side of the distal and middle phalanges of the middle finger.
Partial longitudinal sensory loss on radial side of middle finger over an 80% length (Figure 16-7) corresponds to a 12% impairment of the finger (Table 16-7).
Motion impairment:
              IE% + IF% = finger impairment %. DIP: 0° to 50°  0% + 10% = 10% (Figure 16-21).
PIP: –0° to 60° 7% + 24% = 31% (Figure 16-23).
MP: +20° to 90° 0% +  0% =  0% (Figure 16-25).
10% combined with 31% = 38% finger impairment (see Section 16.4f).
Impairment Rating: The total finger impairment is obtained by combining the sensory impairment (12%) with the motion impairment (38%) by means of the Combined Values Chart (see Section 16.4f). This equals 45% finger impairment, or 9% hand impairment (Table 16-1), 8% upper extremity impairment (Table 16-2), and 5% impairment of the whole person (Table 16-3). Additional estimates are not given for pain and loss of strength.

Subject: 35-year-old man.
History: A 108-kg (240-lb), 172.5-cm (5 ft 8 in), unbelted passenger sustained an open, comminuted fracture of the right femur in an automobile accident. He was treated with an unlocked nail. The fracture healed with shortening.
Current Symptoms: Walks with a decided limp. No pain or weakness.
Physical Exam: Full, pain-free range of motion of the hip and knee. No apparent atrophy of the thigh or calf; no loss of strength. The left leg measures 94 cm (37 in) from the iliac crest to the tip of the medial malleolus. The right leg measures 96.5 cm (38 in).

20% Impairment Due to Gait Derangement From Hip Pain


Subject: 61-year-old woman.
History: Fell on snow-covered steps and landed on her right knee. Developed severe pain in the right groin and later in the hip. No previous problems with her hip. She was last year’s club tennis champion in the over-60 age bracket.
Current Symptoms: Difficulty walking for more than 5 blocks; continued pain; needs a cane when walking outside her home; can no longer play tennis or run.
Physical Exam: Walks with a Trendelenburg gait; full range of motion of the hip and knee.
Complains of pain with full internal rotation of the hip. Neurovascular status intact.
Clinical Studies: Original x-rays: normal. Bone scan and MRI: did not reveal specific abnormalities.
Follow-up x-rays 12 months later: slight narrowing of the hip joint space, which is measured at 3 mm, compared to 4 mm on the left.
Diagnosis: Hip pain with difficulty walking.
Impairment Rating: 20% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Mild narrowing of the hip joint space on x-ray and pain at the extreme of internal rotation indicate early osteoarthritis is a possibility. The narrowing would result in an impairment of 3% of the whole person according to Table 17-3.
However, the gait derangement results in a higher rating according to Table 17-5, and the higher rating should be used when it seems to more accurately represent the clinical situation. The two methods should not be combined because a gait evaluation is never combined with any other method. A rationale for its use should be provided by the evaluator.

1% Impairment Due to Unilateral Muscle Atrophy From a Fracture

Subject: 78-year-old woman.
History: Sustained a closed fracture of her left tibia in a fall at the grocery store. The fracture was undisplaced and treated with a short leg cast for 3 months.
Current Symptoms: Healed fracture; no pain; leg weakness despite extensive physical therapy.
Limited walking.
Physical Exam: Normal gait without support. No malalignment of the leg; neurovascular status is intact. The left calf measures 1.3 cm less than the right at the lower extremity’s greatest circumference. The thigh circumferences 10 cm above the patella are within 1 cm. No discernible weakness by manual muscle testing.
Clinical Studies: X-rays of the tibia: complete healing of the fracture in good alignment.
Diagnosis: Healed tibia fracture.
Impairment Rating: 1% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Fractures can lead to atrophy of an extremity when the limb immobilization is protracted. Especially in older people, it is difficult to regain full girth, despite adequate physical therapy. If no other abnormalities are present, these individuals can be rated by measuring the amount of atrophy. Other measures of muscle function, such as muscle strength or gait derangement, should not be combined with this method.

History: Fractured the right tibia in a fall while mountain climbing. Completed rehabilitation and is at MMI 12 months later.
Current Symptoms: Pain-free walking with a mild limp. Symptoms of fatigue when walking or running. Minimal impact on ADL.
Physical Exam: 2 cm of thigh muscle atrophy and 1 cm of calf muscle atrophy. Manual muscle testing shows normal strength.

The Lower Extremities	531


Clinical Studies: X-rays: undisplaced, healed tibial fracture.
Diagnosis: Healed tibia fracture.
Impairment Rating: 4% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The healing times of fractured tibias are highly variable. Some individuals require prolonged immobilization and inactivity, which may result in significant atrophy. Younger individuals are more likely to be able to rebuild leg muscle mass and function compared with older individuals. Although manual muscle tests were normal, the injured extremity may fatigue more rapidly than usual. Evaluating the impairment in terms of atrophy gives an impairment estimate that more closely matches the person’s capabilities when results of manual muscle testing are normal but atrophy exists. Combine 8% lower extremity thigh impairment (3% whole person impairment) and 3% lower extremity calf impairment (1% whole person impairment) (Table 17-6) to give an estimated 4% whole person impairment (Combined Values Chart, p. 604).

10% Impairment Due to Muscle Weakness From a Patella Fracture

Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Sustained a displaced fracture of the patella with multiple deep abrasions. The fracture required open reduction and internal fixation, but because of the deep, dirty abrasions and superficial infection, the surgery had to be delayed for 5 weeks, during which time he ambulated on crutches. Postoperatively, he was placed in a long leg cast for 6 weeks, followed by physical therapy for 8 weeks with a home exercise program.
Current Symptoms: Occasional discomfort about the knee, inability to walk fast or run, pain after long periods of sitting with the knee flexed, and a general weakness of the leg.
Physical Exam: Healed abrasions; surgical scar. Full range of motion of the knee and no instability. A
1-cm atrophy of the thigh. Manual muscle testing demonstrates weakness of both the quadriceps and the hamstring muscles; both are grade 4. Can flex and extend the knee against some resistance.

Clinical Studies: X-rays: healed patella fracture; no joint space narrowing.
Diagnosis: Residual muscle weakness and surgical scar following a patella fracture.
Impairment Rating: 10% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Manual muscle testing is difficult to perform, but sometimes it is the best method available. Gait is less specific; the atrophy is minor and does not fully reflect the amount of weakness.
There is no peripheral nerve injury. Use Table 177 to determine the grade of the muscle deficit, in this case grade 4. Referring to Table 17-8, extension of the knee with muscular function of grade 4 results in a lower extremity impairment of 12% (5% whole person impairment). Similarly, flexion of the knee at grade 4 results in a lower extremity impairment of 12% (5% whole person impairment). Converting to whole person and combining the two impairments results in a total whole person impairment of 10%.

12% Impairment Due to Muscle Weakness From a Tibia Fracture With Compartment Syndrome

Subject: 30-year-old man.
History: Fell, sustaining a tibia fracture. Postoperatively, developed an anterior compartment syndrome, which was treated surgically.
Current Symptoms: Walks with an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO). When walking without this, he limps and walks with a drop foot. No pain.
Physical Exam: Ankle extension strength is grade 3; thus, he requires an AFO. Also has grade 3 weakness of the extensor hallucis longus. There is calf atrophy of 2 cm, consistent with the weakness observed on manual muscle testing.
Clinical Studies: Radiograph: healed tibia fracture.
Diagnosis: Tibia fracture with compartment syndrome.
Impairment Rating: 12% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The 10% whole person impairment due to ankle weakness (25% lower extremity impairment) (Table 17-8) is combined with 3% whole person impairment (7% lower extremity impairment) for the loss of great toe extension using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604), giving 12% whole person impairment. A muscle strength deficit should not be combined with any other measure of muscle function, such as atrophy.

8% Impairment Due to Decreased Range of Motion From a Tibia Fracture

Subject: 45-year-old woman.
History: Sustained a tibia fracture in a motor vehicle accident.
Current Symptoms: No pain; stiffness about the ankle and foot, with some swelling of the foot and ankle toward evening. Cannot stand for long periods and cannot use shoes with elevated heels.
Physical Exam: Ankle flexion is 6°; ankle extension is 5°. Toe extension is less than 10° for all toes. 1cm atrophy of the left calf. It is difficult to determine the strength of the ankle and toe extensors, but a mild weakness is noted.
Clinical Studies: X-rays: healed tibia fracture with no malalignment.
Diagnosis: Healed tibia frature.
Impairment Rating: 11% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Moderate (6%) loss of ankle flexion (Table 17-11); mild (3%) loss of ankle extension; severe (2%) loss of toe motion (Table 17-14).
Ankle flexion and extension losses are added (6% + 3% = 9%). Combine these with loss of toe motion by means of the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). The whole person impairment is 11%. The range-of-motion (ROM) method is preferable to the atrophy or muscle testing methods. Comparing impairment values from Tables 17-11 and 17-14 (ROM) with those from Table 17-6 (atrophy), the impairment from a ROM assessment is greater than one for atrophy and more accurately characterizes the individual’s impairment. Manual muscle testing is difficult to perform when close to normal because of the lower leg muscles’ limited excursion about the
ankle and toes when motion is severely restricted.

40% Impairment Due to Hip Ankylosis After a Fracture Dislocation of the Hip

Subject: 64-year-old man.
History: Sustained an injury to the right hip in an industrial accident involving a fall from a moving forklift. Landed on the right hip with a central fracture dislocation of the hip joint. An open reduction was performed with less than satisfactory reduction. In the postoperative period, sustained a myocardial infarction, preempting further surgery. The fractures healed, but the hip was ankylosed. With rehabilitation completed, he is at MMI 16 months after injury.
Current Symptoms: No pain in the hip, but difficulty walking, particularly up and down stairs. Can sit comfortably, but has difficulty getting up from a chair and getting in and out of a car.
Physical Exam: Walks with the aid of one crutch. No motion in the right hip, which is ankylosed in 55° of flexion, 12° of external rotation, and 10° of abduction. Neurovascular status is intact.
Clinical Studies: Radiograph: healed right hip fracture-dislocation fused in flexion; external rotation and abduction deformity.
Diagnosis: Fracture dislocation of right hip with malunion.
Impairment Rating: 40% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The impairment rating for a hip that is ankylosed in the optimal position is 50% of the lower extremity. Add additional impairment percentages when the position is less than optimal. In this case, the flexion position of 55° results in 25% additional lower extremity impairment, external rotation of 12° results in another 12% lower extremity impairment, and abduction of 10° results in a 25% lower extremity impairment.
Adding 50% + 25% + 12% + 25% = 112%. Since
no impairment can be greater than that for an amputation, the impairment of the lower extremity is 100%, which is equivalent to a 40% whole person impairment.

32% Impairment Due to Ankylosis of the Knee


Subject: 41-year-old man.
History: Sustained a comminuted open distal right femur and proximal tibia fracture in a car accident; became infected and healed with ankylosis.
Current Symptoms: No pain. Has difficulty walking, sitting, and driving. Some swelling of the lower leg by the end of the day.
Physical Exam: Several well-healed scars about the knee. There is ankylosis in 20° of flexion with
7° valgus and normal rotation compared to the left leg.
Clinical Studies: X-rays: well-healed tibia and femur fractures.
Diagnosis: Tibia and femur fractures with ankylosis of the knee joint.
Impairment Rating: 32% impairment of the whole person.

The Lower Extremities	541
Comment: Ankylosis in the optimal position results in a 27% whole person impairment (67% lower extremity impairment). This man has a 20° flexion deformity, rather than a 10° to 15° position, which would be optimal. Adding 5% whole person impairment from Table 17-22 to the 27% yields a total whole person impairment rating
of 32%.

11% Impairment Due to Ankle Fracture

Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Sustained a severe distal tibial and intraarticular ankle fracture in a fall from a height. The fracture was treated with external fixation and healed with bony ankylosis of the ankle. History of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Current Symptoms: No pain; walks slowly; difficulty walking on uneven surfaces.
Physical Exam: The ankle is ankylosed in 15° dorsiflexion and 7° varus.
Clinical Studies: X-rays: healed distal tibial and intra-articular ankle fracture. Fusion across the ankle joint.
Diagnosis: Ankle fracture with ankylosis.
Impairment Rating: 20% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: 11% whole person impairment related to ankle flexion (Table 17-24) and 10% whole person impairment related to the varus deformity (Table 17-25). These ankle impairments are combined, giving a 20% whole person impairment (Combined Values Chart, p. 604). Because of the diabetic condition and marginal circulation to the ankle region, corrective surgery is not recommended. The impairment method for malpositioning and ankylosis is more appropriate than using the method for an intra-articular ankle fracture (see Table 17-33). An impairment percent related to diabetes, if appropriate, should be combined with the lower extremity impairment.

14% Impairment Due to Ankle Ankylosis and Calcaneus Fracture

Subject: 41-year-old woman.
History: Fractured her ankle and calcaneal tuberosity in a fall from a height. Treated with a cast and healed with a bony fusion.

The Lower Extremities	543


Current Symptoms: Walks without support but with special shoes. Difficulty walking on uneven ground and has swelling when she sits for long periods of time.
Physical Exam: Considerable swelling about the heel with widening; no tenderness; no motion at the ankle.
Clinical Studies: X-rays: fused ankle with fractured calcaneus and a 5° flexion angle at ankle joint.
The tibia–os calcis angle is 100°.
Diagnosis: Ankle ankylosis with a healed fracture of the distal tibia and calcaneus.
Impairment Rating: 14% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The optimal ankle position is neutral; 5° of flexion is a small deformity and does not add to the impairment. The ankle rating for ankylosis is 4% whole person impairment. The normal
tibia–os calcis angle is >120°; 100° indicates an additional 10% whole person impairment. Both impairments are added, resulting in a 14% whole person impairment.

3% Impairment Due to Crush Injury of the Toes
Subject: 52-year-old man.
History: A metal object weighing over 68 kg (150 lb) fell on his toes at work. He sustained a crush injury to the right forefoot involving the soft tissues as well as multiple fractures to the toes.
Treatment was nonoperative, and the soft tissue and fractures healed.
Current Symptoms: Difficulty walking fast or long distances; inability to run; stiffness of all toes.
Physical Exam: The forefoot is mildly swollen and has several healed scars. Range of motion of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe is 15° of extension and 15° of flexion. There is no motion of the other toe joints. The toes are in a normal position of function. Walks with a mild limp; unable to push off normally.
Clinical Studies: X-rays: healed toe fractures.


Diagnosis: Crush injury to the forefoot with multiple fractures.
Impairment Rating: 3% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Mild loss of motion of the great toe corresponds to a 1% whole person impairment (Table 17-14). Add this to the 2% whole person impairment due to ankylosis of toes 2 through 5 in a functional position (Table 17-30).

Subject: 48-year-old man.
History: Fell from a loading dock 23 years ago, sustaining a right tibia fracture.
Current Symptoms: Resumed work. Over the last several years, had right knee pain toward the end of the day. Occasional mild swelling of the knee joint.
Physical Exam: The fracture healed with a 10° varus deformity of the right tibia. He has almost full range of motion of the injured knee, 0° through 125°, and mild crepitation.

The Lower Extremities	545


Clinical Studies: Standing x-rays: cartilage interval is 2 mm on the medial side of the right knee.
Diagnosis: Moderate degenerative arthritis of the right knee.
Impairment Rating: 15% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Symptoms worsen after a day’s work. The cause of pain and impairment is the development of osteoarthritis in the knee joint. Accurate x-rays are an objective way to estimate this impairment. Based on the x-rays, this individual has an 8% whole person impairment and 20% impairment of the lower extremity due to arthritis (Table 17-31). The 8% whole person impairment related to knee arthritis should be combined with an 8% whole person impairment due to the tibia fracture malalignment, 10° varus of the tibia (see Table 1733). Combining two 8% whole person impairments yields a 15% whole person impairment (Combined Values Chart, p. 604).

28% Impairment Due to Amputation From a Crush Injury

Subject: 35-year-old man.
History: Sustained a crush injury to the left leg in a motor vehicle accident. Below-knee amputation.
Current Symptoms: Ambulates with a below-knee prosthesis, without the need for a cane or support. Has no pain in the stump and no phantom pain.
Physical Exam: The left knee is stable, has no sign of arthritis, and has full motion.
Clinical Studies: X-rays: 13 cm (5 in) of retained proximal tibia in the stump. The stump is well healed, and he has not had any trouble with stump breakdown.
Diagnosis: Below-knee left leg amputation.
Impairment Rating: 28% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Table 17-32 shows that this condition receives a 28% whole person impairment rating. In this case, there was no concomitant knee injury. If there is an injury to the knee, or more proximal to the leg, that may also need to be rated.

11% Impairment Due to a Tibia Fracture


Subject: 40-year-old woman.
History: Sustained a comminuted midshaft tibial fracture in a skiing accident. The fracture healed with shortening and angulation. She was advised of the risks of midshaft tibial osteotomy and lengthening, and she declined surgery.
Current Symptoms: Mild pain about the right knee and ankle, particularly when walking on uneven surfaces. Mild swelling of the lower leg; difficulty walking more than 5 blocks without a rest period.
Physical Exam: There is a right leg shortening of
2.5 cm. The lower leg fracture has healed with a 10° varus angle. Ranges of motion of the knee and ankle are normal.
Clinical Studies: Radiograph: healed tibia fracture with varus angulation and 2.5 cm of shortening.
Diagnosis: Healed tibia fracture with varus angulation.
Impairment Rating: 11% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The lower extremity impairment estimate for a tibia fracture that heals with a 10° varus angulation is 20% (Table 17-33), or 8% whole person impairment; the lower extremity impairment estimate for 2.5 cm of shortening, using interpolation, is 7%, or 3% whole person impairment (Table 17-4). The 8% and 3% whole person impairments are combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). The whole person impairment is 11%. Impairment due to malunion of a fracture should be estimated according to the diagnosis. Any associated muscle weakness or atrophy is included in the diagnosis-related estimates, but shortening is a separate impairment. (See cross-usage Table 17-2.) If there were an associated nerve palsy, the fracture and nerve palsy impairment percents would be combined (Combined Values Chart).

10% Impairment Due to Skin Loss


Subject: 56-year-old man.
History: Insulin-dependent diabetic who stepped on a nail at work and developed Pseudomonas cellulitis of the heel. The heel pad became necrotic and required debridement. A subsequent fullthickness skin graft was successfully applied to the plantar aspect of the heel.
Current Symptoms: 1 year later, standing tolerance is limited to 45 minutes and walking tolerance is limited to 1 mile. Occasional minor breakdown of the full-thickness graft. Never developed osteomyelitis or recurring infections.
Physical Exam: Normal motion in the ankle and subtalar joints. Graft site well healed.
Clinical Studies: None.
Diagnosis: Puncture wound with 2° infection of right heel. Status post–split thickness skin graft.
Impairment Rating: 10% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Table 17-36 indicates a 10% whole person impairment since his condition limits daily activities, as well as standing and walking time. Any subsequent impairment from the diabetes should be combined with the musculoskeletal impairment.

Example 17-17
4% Impairment Due to Peripheral Nerve Injury

Subject: 22-year-old man.
History: Sustained a shrapnel-type injury at work when a part in his lathe broke and a sharp metal fragment struck him near the groin. The wound was surgically explored, and he was found to have a totally transected femoral nerve. The femoral vessels were not injured. The nerve was repaired, with return of significant function.
Current Symptoms: 2 years postinjury, walks without a cane or brace but with an abnormal gait, hyperextending his knee by using his hip extensors, just prior to weight-bearing.
Physical Exam: Decreased light touch perception in the leg in the distribution of the saphenous nerve (the distal sensory branch of the femoral nerve). This area of skin on the medial leg has retained sharp dull perception. Blisters on the medial

malleolus from his shoe rubbing on an area where the skin has decreased sensation. Quadriceps strength is judged as grade 4; moderate resistance by the examiner prevents full knee extension.
Clinical Studies: None.
Diagnosis: Partial femoral nerve palsy.
Impairment Rating: 4% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The operation report documents that the femoral nerve was injured. Examination confirms that the sensory deficit is in the saphenous nerve distribution, and the motor weakness affects the quadriceps muscle (knee extension). This is consistent with a femoral nerve injury with incomplete recovery.
Sensory impairment can be rated using Tables 17-37 and 16-10. According to Table 17-37, the maximum value for a totally destroyed and non-
functioning femoral nerve due to sensory loss and pain is 9% lower extremity impairment. The sensory deficit and pain are forgotten with activity, so a severity multiplier of grade 4 may be chosen from Table 16-10; grade 4 includes a range of multipliers from 1% to 25%. If a multiplier of 20% is chosen, 20% of the 9% maximum value of the nerve is 2% lower extremity impairment for loss of sensation and pain.
The motor weakness impairment can be calculated in a similar manner. Table 17-37 indicates that the maximal impairment for total loss of femoral nerve motor function is 37% lower extremity impairment. The exam shows that the man can move the leg through a full range of motion against gravity, but with only minimal added resistance. This is grade 4 weakness according to manual muscle testing criteria. Table 16-11 indicates that grade 4 weakness can qualify for a severity multiplier of anywhere from 1% to 25%. If a multiplier of 25% is chosen since the weakness is very significant, 25% multiplied by the 37% maximal value of the nerve for weakness yields a total of 9% lower extremity impairment.
Using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) to combine the 9% lower extremity impairment for motor weakness with the 2% lower extremity impairment for loss of sensation and pain yields a rating of 11% lower extremity impairment. The 11% lower extremity impairment is equivalent to 4% whole person impairment (11% ? 0.4 = 4%).

Example 17-18
39% Impairment Due to Causalgia

Subject: 32-year-old woman.
History: Fell and struck the anterior aspect of her knee; sustained a bruise with ecchymosis but no fractures when she jumped 4.5 feet from a truck dock to the ground below. She was much worse 1 month later, with “terrible pain,” swelling (edema), and a red, warm leg that sweated when no other part of her was sweating.
Current Symptoms: 2 years later, ambulating with two crutches and not bearing weight on the right leg. Constant severe pain in the leg, despite treatment that included all known modalities for causalgia.
Physical Exam: Leg remains swollen and pale, with skin atrophy and atrophy of the toes equivalent to “fingerprints.” On active range-of-motion testing, she does not cooperate due to pain, with very little active motion in any joint in the leg. Does not cooperate with manual muscle testing, as the testing provokes pain. On sensory exam, there is no loss of sensation; rather, any touching of the leg provokes severe pain (allodynia).
Clinical Studies: Bone scan postinjury: diffuse periarticular increased uptake at the knee, ankle, and foot on the “third phase” or 3to 4-hour delayed images. Current x-rays of the leg: only extensive osteoporosis.
Diagnosis: Causalgia, right leg.
Impairment Rating: 39% impairment of the whole person.


Comment: This case is typical of severe, type 1 CRPS, or causalgia. The leg is very difficult to examine, as traditional physical examination maneuvers such as manual muscle testing, reflex testing, sensory examination, and active range of motion all provoke complaints of severe pain and limited or no cooperation. This makes an impairment evaluation based on the traditional physical examination impossible. In this individual, no single peripheral nerve has been injured, and the pain involves the entire limb. Thus, trying to rate this as a peripheral nerve injury is inappropriate. No specific method described in the lower extremity or upper extremity chapters adequately covers this unique circumstance.
The pathology in CRPS is currently believed to occur in the central nervous system, so the evaluator should use the station and gait impairment criteria in Table 13-15 to rate lower extremity impairments due to lesions in the central nervous system (brain and/or spinal cord). Table 13-15 rates this individual’s impairment at 20% to 39% impairment of the whole person. Since her pain is severe and functional ADL are compromised, a 39% impairment rating is appropriate.
Comparing this woman’s status with the guidelines for gait derangement indicated in Table 17-5 suggests that since she requires routine use of two canes or two crutches, she could be rated at 39% whole person impairment. The leg is totally nonfunctional; thus, she is similar to an amputee and should be rated at 39% whole person impairment. The rating of at 39% whole person impairment is thus supportable by several lines of reasoning.

8% Impairment Caused by Vascular Disease Due to a Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

Subject: 45-year-old man.
History: Sustained a closed but displaced tibial fracture at work. Treated with cast immobilization until the fracture healed. Postoperative course was complicated by a DVT in the injured left leg.
Current Symptoms: At MMI, 1 year postinjury, standing tolerance is described as 1 hour and walking tolerance is described as almost 1 mile. Only medication is aspirin. He has not had recurrent venous thrombosis. Able to do most ADL.
Physical Exam: No weakness on manual muscle testing. Knee, ankle, and subtalar joints all have full motion. Chronic venous insufficiency of the left leg as a result of the DVT. The right lower extremity is normal, with no edema or varices. The left leg has 2+ pitting edema when examined in the morning, despite the use of Jobst compression hose 16 hours every day. Intermittent stasis dermatitis about the ankle, but no permanent skin changes other than discoloration.

Clinical Studies: Healed fracture with no angulation, displacement, or shortening.
Diagnosis: Peripheral vascular disease, post-DVT, and healed tibia fracture.
Impairment Rating: 8% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Table 17-38 shows that the impairment for peripheral vascular (venous) disease can be estimated as a class 2 impairment, which ranges from 10% to 39% lower extremity impairment. He has the criterion of persistent edema of a moderate degree, incompletely controlled by elastic supports. The impairment can be estimated at midway between the lower and the higher impairment for class 2, or at 20% lower extremity impairment (20% ? 0.4 = 8% whole person impairment).

7% Impairment Due to Peripheral Nervous System Injury

Subject: 22-year-old man.
History: Fell approximately 20 feet from a ladder, injuring his right knee and left toe. Sustained an anterior cruciate ligament rupture to the right knee and a lateral meniscus tear, treated with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and partial lateral meniscectomy. Sustained a common peroneal nerve neuropraxia that was treated with observation and a temporary ankle/foot orthosis. Had a fracture/dislocation of the left great toe at the interphalangeal (IP) joint that required closed reduction only.
Current Symptoms: Postrehabilitation, has residual soreness in the right knee after vigorous activities and constant stiffness in the left great toe.
Physical Examination: Right lower extremity: Walks normally without support. Uses an occasional sport brace for vigorous activities, but does not require this for most ADL. The scars around the right knee are well healed. No incisional tenderness. There is no effusion or tenderness along the joint lines.
There is 1-cm atrophy of the right thigh compared to the left, as well as 1-cm calf atrophy compared to the left. Manual muscle testing is normal except for right foot evertor strength, which is 4/5. Range of motion of the right knee is from 0° to 130° of flexion, as compared to 0° to 138° on the left.
Stability testing reveals 1+ Lachman and anterior drawer and a negative pivot shift exam. Sensation is decreased to light touch in the superficial peroneal distribution on the dorsum of the foot and is forgotten with activity. No obvious deep peroneal deficit. Left lower extremity: The only gross abnormality identified is great toe IP flexion, which is limited to 10°.

Clinical Studies: Based on the operative report, the individual had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a mid–one third patellar tendon graft using interference screw fixation. The report suggested that approximately one half of the posterior portion of the lateral meniscus had been removed. X-rays of the right knee: prior anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, but no degenerative changes seen. X-rays of the great toe: healed, nondisplaced fracture of the proximal phalanx.
The joints appear normal.
Diagnosis: Residual, partial common peroneal nerve neuropraxia, status post-lateral meniscectomy.

8% Impairment Due to Decreased Range of Motion From Hip Dislocation and Fixation

Subject: 35-year-old woman.
History: Sustained a dislocation of the right hip with severe comminution of the posterior acetabulum. Underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the posterior acetabular wall. Because of the comminution and inability to obtain a stable fracture fixation, the surgeon elected to keep her in skeletal traction for 4 weeks. She healed, but with some loss of joint space and significant loss of range of motion.
Current Symptoms: Aching pain in the right groin toward the end of the day, after household activities and caring for her children.
Physical Exam: Walks with a slight antalgic gait on the right. Range-of-motion measurements of the hip are as follows: flexion = 50°; extension = 15°; flexion contracture, internal rotation = 20°, external rotation = 15°; abduction = 20°; adduction = 5°. There is 3 cm of atrophy of the thigh and 2 cm of atrophy of the calf.

The Lower Extremities	557


Clinical Studies: Repeat x-rays of the pelvis: only 1 mm of joint space in the right hip.
Diagnosis: Right hip dislocation with internal fixation; secondary osteoarthritis.
Impairment Rating: 8% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Range of motion, atrophy, and arthritis are the three possible methods of rating this individual’s impairment. According to Table 17-2, range-of-motion parameters should not be combined with either arthritis or atrophy. Use the range-of-motion method because it is more specific and best characterizes the impairment.
Flexion of 50° qualifies for severe impairment according to Table 17-9. The other measurements qualify as less than severe, but since one of the measurements qualifies for severe, it should be used as the basis; the impairment is therefore 20% of the lower extremity. This converts to a whole person impairment of 8% (20% ? 0.4 = 8%).

10% Impairment Due to Limb Length Discrepancy, Malalignment of the Tibial Shaft Fracture, and Atrophy

Subject: 45-year-old man.
History: Fell from a scaffold and sustained an undisplaced tibial plateau fracture of the right leg and an open fracture of the left tibia and fibula. The open tibia/fibula fracture was treated by irrigation and debridement and internal fixation with an intramedullary Rush pin. The tibial plateau fracture was treated with a Bledsoe brace, locked in extension for 3 weeks, and then treated with progressive mobilization.
Current Symptoms: Unable to do some activities of daily living because of pain in both legs when lifting or standing.


Physical Exam: Full range of motion of both knees.
There is a 12° valgus deformity of the left leg. Both knees are stable. There is 2 cm of atrophy of the left calf compared to the right. Neurovascular status of both legs is intact. No muscle weakness.
Clinical Studies: X-rays: healing of all fractures; the right knee fracture has healed without displacement, but the left tibial fracture has healed with 12° of valgus angulation. Teleroentgenograms:
1.5 cm of shortening.
Diagnosis: Healed right tibia plateau fracture; healed left tibia fracture with malalignment.
Impairment Rating: 10% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The undisplaced right tibia plateau fracture has a 5% lower extremity impairment rating, and the valgus angulation of the left tibial fracture has 20% impairment of the lower extremity according to Table 17-33. There is no further impairment rating for leg shortening since it is less than 2 cm. The individual does not receive an impairment rating for left calf atrophy according to Table 17-6 since diagnosis-based estimates are used. The left lower extremity rating of 20% converts to 8% whole person impairment (20% ? 0.4). The right lower extremity impairment of 5% equates to 2% whole person impairment (5% ? 0.4). Combining the 8% whole person impairment from the left leg and the 2% whole person impairment from the right leg equals a 10% whole person impairment for the injuries. The pain is accounted for in the impairment ratings.

10% Impairment Due to Undisplaced Tibial Plateau Fracture and Peroneal Neuropathy
Subject: 55-year-old man.
History: Sustained a lateral tibial plateau and proximal fibula fracture when a metal lathe threw a piece of scrap metal against his leg. Also had a complete peroneal nerve laceration. Treated with open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture and repair of the peroneal nerve.
Postoperatively, he was placed in a locked Bledsoe brace for 3 weeks and then was progressively mobilized. The fracture healed without deformity, but there was only partial return of nerve function.
Current Symptoms: Aching along the lateral side of the leg. Walks without a brace but has a slight steppage gait, and when walking long distances, prefers to use an AFO.
Physical Exam: 2° limitation in the extension of the knee; flexes to 100°. No malalignment. There is
2.5 cm of atrophy of the calf. Knee ligaments are stable. Numbness on the lateral side of the lower leg and foot that is judged to be grade 2 according to Table 16-12. He has weakness of the peroneal innervated muscles that is judged to be grade 3 according to Table 16-11.
Clinical Studies: Radiograph: healed tibial and fibula fracture.
Diagnosis: Undisplaced tibial plateau fracture; peroneal neuropathy.
Impairment Rating: 10% impairment of the whole person.

Comment: According to Table 17-33, this individual receives a 5% lower extremity impairment for the undisplaced tibial plateau fracture. According to Table 17-2, the rater should not use atrophy in conjunction with a diagnosis-based estimate.
The neurologic deficit requires a separate rating. Table 16-10 states that a grade 4 sensory lesion results in a 1% to 25% sensory deficit. Since this man has considerable numbness, he is rated at 25%. Multiplying the 25% by the 5% assigned from Table 17-37 for a complete common peroneal sensory deficit equals 1.25%, rounded down to a 1% sensory deficit. Table 16-11 states that a grade 3 motor lesion equates to a 26% to 50% deficit. Since the man must wear a brace parttime, 50% is appropriate. Multiplying that 50% by the 42% from Table 17-37 for a complete common peroneal motor deficit equals 21%.
Combining the 1% lower extremity impairment for the sensory deficit with the 21% lower extremity impairment for the motor deficit results in 22% lower extremity impairment for the nerve injury. Combining the 5% lower extremity impairment for the fracture and the 22% impairment for the nerve injury results in a 26% lower extremity impairment, or a 10% whole person impairment (26% ? 0.4 = 10.4%, or 10%).

Example 17-24
15% Impairment Due to Hip Replacement
Subject: 35-year-old woman (same individual as in Example 17-21).
History: The individual described in Example 17-21 developed progressive arthritis of the hip and underwent total hip arthroplasty. She is now 2 years postoperative and is seen for repeat impairment evaluation.
Current Symptoms: Slight pain, and walks with a slight limp. Climbs stairs normally, puts on socks and shoes with difficulty because of persistent limitation of flexion and limited external rotation, sits unlimited amounts of time, and does not use public transportation, although she thinks she could. Never uses a cane and can walk six blocks without stopping. Has difficulty doing activities with her family.
Physical Exam: Continued atrophy of the thigh and calf. A flexion contracture of 15°. No other contractures, and her leg lengths are equalized.
Flexion is 90°, abduction is 20°, adduction is 10°, external rotation is 20°, and internal rotation is 20°.
Clinical Studies: Hip replacement well positioned.
Diagnosis: Hip replacement.
Impairment Rating: 15% impairment of the whole person.


Comment: According to Table 17-2, atrophy should not be considered if the diagnosis method is used (Table 17-34). The individual is assigned 40 points for pain, 8 points for a slight limp, 11 points for not using a cane, and 8 points for being able to walk six blocks. She is also assigned 4 points for stair climbing, 2 points for difficulty putting on socks, 4 points for unlimited sitting ability, and 1 point for the ability to use public transportation. She has a fixed flexion contracture without leg length discrepancy, so she receives an additional 3 points for deformity. For range of motion, she receives no points for flexion motion but receives 1 each for the other four motions (given the flexion contracture). That totals 85 points. According to Table 17-33, the impairment is 37% lower extremity or 15% whole person.

Example 17-25
25% Impairment Due to Transmetatarsal Amputation


Subject: 60-year-old man.
History: Caught his right foot in a construction ditch with a machine operating and sustained a mangled foot. Treated with debridement and internal fixation of multiple fractures of the metatarsals, os calcus, and ankle. The forefoot became infected and required a transmetatarsal amputation. He finally healed, but he had significant residual stiffness of the foot. Was unable to do heavy work.
Current Symptoms: Stiffness in the foot and ankle. Able to walk in lace-up shoes with a shoe insert. Limps and has atrophy of the calf. Unable to stand for sustained periods of time without pain.

560	Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment


Physical Exam: Multiple scars, all healed. Ankle flexion contracture of 10° and can plantar flex to 25°. Fixed valgus deformity of the os calcus measuring 15°. No further inversion from 15°.
Clinical Studies: Radiographs: healed foot and ankle fractures with valgus deformity.
Diagnosis: Healed transmetatarsal amputation.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: The amputation results in an impairment of 57% of the foot or 40% of the lower extremity according to Table 17-32. Impairments other than the amputation need to be considered. According to Table 17-13, the heel deformity results in a lower extremity impairment of 25%. Since this is a deformity, subtalar motion is not considered.
Loss of ankle dorsiflexion, according to Table 1711, results in a lower extremity impairment of 15% (moderate). Combining the 40%, the 25%, and the 15% results in a lower extremity impairment of 62%. By multiplying the lower extremity impairment by 0.4, a whole person impairment of 24.8%, or 25%, is obtained.

Example 18-1


Subject: 28-year-old woman.
History: Individual who is otherwise healthy experiences approximately 20 severe headache events per year.
Current Symptoms: Each headache event begins at night and reaches maximal intensity within 2 to 3 hours. Untreated, average duration is 8 to 12 hours. Headache is associated with severe nausea and vomiting, light-headedness, moderately to severely blurred vision, and diarrhea. Woman is completely asymptomatic between headaches.
Physical Exam: Generally healthy woman.
Neurologic examination and past medical history are otherwise normal. Using Table 18-4, the pain intensity score is 6.
Activity Interference (based on protocol described in Table 18-4): Woman is able to perform all ADL, having some difficulties only during the headache episodes. Activity limitations score is 5.
Emotional Distress (based on protocols described in Table 18-4): She reports moderate emotional distress and is concerned about her ability to meet role and responsibilities. The emotional distress score is 4.
Pain Behaviors (based on Table 18-5): No pain behaviors demonstrated; pain behavior score is 0.
Credibility: Credibility score is +5.
Diagnosis: Migraine.


Impairment Rating: Based on the procedures described in Tables 18-4 through 18-7, the individual’s total pain-related impairment score is 20. She is therefore classified as having mild painrelated impairment. No ratable impairment based on organ or body part dysfunction.
Comment: During her attacks, this woman is completely impaired by the severity of her pain, its accompaniments, and the treatment that is required to relieve symptoms. Impairment is intermittent, lasting only the duration of the attack and the effects of the medication. She is otherwise unimpaired.

Example 18-2

Subject: 42-year-old man.
History: Individual developed right carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) 2.5 years ago while working as a cement mixer. Underwent CTS release 2 months after onset of symptoms. Postoperatively, developed swelling of right hand, along with severe, diffuse pain. Was diagnosed with RSD. Has failed stellate ganglion blocks, numerous medication trials, and a vigorous physical therapy program.
Current Symptoms: Pain in the right hand and forearm, which can extend up to the shoulder. Pain constant at 3-5/10 when inactive. Increased pain and severe swelling of hand with any vigorous right upper extremity (RUE) activity. Based on Table 18-4, pain severity score is 10.

Physical Exam: Dramatic swelling of right hand, along with discoloration and excessive sweating. Range of motion (ROM) of fingers markedly reduced secondary to swelling. Mild hypersensitivity to tactile stimulation of hand. No sensory loss. Demonstrates pain-limited weakness in all muscle groups of distal RUE.
Activity Interference (based on protocol described in Table 18-4): Activity limitation score is 18. Unable to use RUE for any physically demanding activities.
Emotional Distress (based on protocol described in Table 18-4): Severely depressed over ongoing pain and work disability; frequent thoughts of suicide. Emotional distress score is 10.
Pain Behaviors (using the global rating in Table 18-5): A number of pain behaviors that appeared inconsistent with the diagnosis of CTS or RSD were observed, including guarded and protective movements of the lumbar spine and the left upper extremity. These behaviors were judged to be excessive and incongruent with the diagnosed conditions and were rated –7.
Credibility: Moderate; credibility score is +3.
Diagnosis: CTS and RSD.
Impairment Rating: (1) Conventional: 22% whole person impairment due to markedly restricted ROM of all digits of the right hand. (2) Pain related: Using protocol described in Tables 18-4 through 18-7, the individual is assigned a total pain-related impairment score of 28, corresponding to moderate pain-related impairment. The pain-related impairment is felt to be ratable and to be adequately encapsulated within the impairment rating in the conventional impairment rating described above.
Comment: In RSD, impairment is typically secondary to pain and is not easily encompassed by the conventional impairment rating system. This person is unusual in that the swelling and consequent reduced ROM of the fingers was ratable.

Example 18-3

Subject: 45-year-old man.
History: History of nine lumbar surgeries over a
15-year period. Started with an L4-5 diskectomy; now is fused from L2 to the sacrum.
Current Symptoms: Low back pain with intermittent radiation into proximal right lower extremity. Also has pain wrapping around his flanks in an L2 distribution and numbness in an S1 pattern in the left lower extremity. Baseline pain is present daily and is described as 4/10 in intensity. About 10 flare-ups per year during which he is confined to bed for several days. On the basis of Table 18-4, pain intensity score is 12.
Physical Exam: Stands leaning forward and to the right; is unable to achieve an erect posture.
Palpation reveals significant myofascial pain throughout lumbar and gluteal region. ROM of the lumbar spine is severely restricted in all planes.
No sciatic tension signs. Neurologic exam shows signs of a left S1 radiculopathy and diffuse, paininhibited weakness in the right lower extremity.
Activity Interference (based on protocol described in Table 18-4): Activity limitation score is 23. Individual is severely limited in sitting, standing, walking, and lifting; he is often unable to travel by car.

Emotional Distress (based on protocol described in Table 18-4): Individual suffers from ongoing depression and experiences acute anxiety during pain flare-ups. Emotional distress score is 6.
Pain Behaviors (based on the rating of global pain behaviors in Table 18-5): Some of the man’s pain behaviors seemed ambiguous and somewhat excessive compared to those of others with similar organ dysfuction. The individual was given a global pain behavior rating of –3.
Credibility: Overall credibility is rated as high, based on reports from the individual’s treating physician that his activity limitations have been very consistent over a number of years and that he has persevered in work efforts despite his severe lumbar spine condition. He is given a global score of +8 for credibility.
Diagnosis: Lumbar postlaminectomy syndrome.
Impairment Rating: (1) Conventional: 20% whole person impairment based on DRE category IV.
(2) Pain related: The total pain-related impairment score is 46, indicating moderately severe painrelated impairment. The impairment is ratable and felt not to be adequately encapsulated in the conventional impairment rating given above.
Comment: The individual has significant impairment by both the conventional and pain-related impairment rating systems. His pain-related impairment, however, is substantially higher than his conventional impairment. He shows a temporal pattern of pain that is typical among people with chronic back pain. He has ongoing pain that is moderately disabling, with frequent superimposed flare-ups that are severely disabling.

Example 18-4

Subject: 42-year-old woman.
History: Eight years ago, individual developed bilateral aching forearm pain and numbness of the hands in the context of repetitive wrist/hand motions in her job as an assay technician. Has undergone bilateral carpal tunnel releases, bilateral de Quervain’s releases, and bilateral superficial radial neurectomies.
Current Symptoms: Constant burning pain in the dorsal aspect of both forearms and hands, along with aching in the volar aspect of both forearms. This background pain is rated as 6-8/10 in intensity. Even mildly forceful use of either hand (eg, pulling on the doorknob of a heavy door) causes pain to increase to 10/10 and can sometimes provoke flare-ups that last several days. Based on Table 18-4, the pain intensity score is 19.
Physical Exam: Mild swelling of both hands.
Multiple scars from the surgeries. No definite temperature or color changes. No abnormal sudomotor activity or trophic changes. ROM of fingers and wrists almost full. Woman recoils with any tactile stimulation of either dorsal forearm or hand. Two-point discrimination is impaired in the distribution of the superficial radial sensory nerve bilaterally. Motor function cannot be tested validly because of severe pain inhibition.

Activity Interference (based on protocol described in Table 18-4): Activities limitation score is 26. Individual is barely able to manage basic ADL, such as dressing herself or maintaining personal hygiene. She cannot type for more than 2 minutes and is unable to drive.
Emotional Distress (based on protocol described in Table 18-4): The individual demonstrates severe anxiety and depression in relation to her pain, despite aggressive antidepressant medication therapy. Emotional distress score is 9.
Pain Behavior (using the global pain behavior score in Table 18-5): The woman appeared quite stoic throughout the evaluation. She demonstrated cutaneous hypersensitivity over the dorsal aspect of both forearms and wrists and significant paininhibited weakness of distal upper extremity muscles. However, strength was excellent in proximal muscles. Overall, the pain behaviors observed were judged to be mildly concordant with her medical condition. Pain behavior score is +1.
Credibility: The woman is felt to be sincerely expressing her suffering. Credibility score is +6.
Diagnosis: Bilateral superficial radial neuropathy.
Impairment Rating: (1) Conventional: 5% impairment of the upper extremity due to loss of sensory function in the right superficial radial nerve and 5% impairment of the upper extremity due to loss of sensory function in the left superficial radial nerve. Using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) yields a total of 10% impairment of the upper extremities, or 6% whole person impairment.
(2) Pain related: Using the procedures described in Tables 18-4 through 18-7, the total pain-related impairment score is 69, indicating severe painrelated impairment. It is felt that the impairment is ratable and not adequately encapsulated in the conventional impairment rating provided above.
Comment: The conventional impairment rating is low because the only measurable loss of function the individual has is in sensation of skin innervated by the superficial radial nerve. However, she has neuropathic pain in both upper extremities that causes incapacitating pain. Thus, the painrelated impairment is markedly higher than the conventionally rated impairment.

Section 15.4
Subject: 25-year-old man.
History: New onset of back and left leg pain while lifting on the job. Initially presented with muscle spasm, a positive SLR on the left side at 60°, a positive crossed SLR at 70°, and an absent left Achilles tendon reflex. An MRI revealed a left posterolateral disk herniation at L5-S1. Was treated with analgesics and physical therapy but did not improve. Underwent surgical diskectomy 3 months after the injury. Some improvement in the symptoms after 9 months of rehabilitation.
Current Symptoms: Persistent back and thigh pain and numbness along the lateral side of the foot at rest. Unable to do his usual recreational and some household activities.
Physical Exam: Restricted lumbar motion. Loss of the Achilles reflex, numbness in the S1 nerve root distribution, and pain in the posterior thigh and leg on SLR.
Clinical Studies: Original MRI: herniated disk at
L5-S1. Postoperative MRI with gadolinium: fibrosis but no residual or recurrent herniation.
Diagnosis: Chronic low back pain and radiculopathy.
Impairment Rating: 13% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: Symptoms, physical findings, and imaging studies are all consistent with a symptomatic herniated disk. Symptoms did not completely resolve after surgical treatment, with subjective and objective signs of persistent radiculopathy.
Individual therefore qualifies for DRE lumbar category III. Because of significant persistent symptoms that limit the ability to perform ADL and continued objective findings, the impairment rating is increased to 13%.

Section 15.6a
Subject: 37-year-old woman.
History: Onset of pain in the neck and right arm along the radial aspect and into the thumb following a medium-speed rear-end auto collision.
Individual failed conservative treatment, and an MRI showed a herniated disk at C6-7. Underwent a diskectomy of the sixth cervical disk and fusion of C6 to C7. Healed uneventfully and returned to work 4 months after the injury.
Current Symptoms: Occasional neck pain with physical activity. Upper extremity pain resolved.
Physical Exam: Slight loss of cervical spine motion.
Neurologic examination is normal.
Clinical Studies: Radiographs: healed C6-7 fusion.
Diagnosis: Herniated disk C6-7 with C7 radiculopathy resolved following anterior cervical diskectomy and C6-7 fusion.
Impairment Rating: 25% impairment of the whole person.
Comment: This individual meets criteria for DRE cervical category IV because of alteration of motion segment integrity due to fusion.
