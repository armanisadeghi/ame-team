Introduction
This chapter provides criteria for evaluating permanent impairments due to anatomic impairments of the hand and the upper extremity. The methods discussed in this chapter for evaluation of upper extremity impairment due to amputation, sensory loss, and abnormal motion or ankylosis were based on A. B. Swanson’s work and adapted from the fourth edition and updated with input from many of the specialty societies listed in the preface.

The following revisions have been made for the fifth edition: (1) basic principles of assessment have been clarified, (2) updates of the latest scientific information in assessment of upper extremity impairments have been provided, (3) measurement of range of motion of the fingers has been clarified to also detect limited motion due to limited excursion of tendons,
(4) impairment determination for nerve entrapment syndromes has been clarified, (5) the criteria for diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome are discussed and consistent throughout the book,
(6) criteria for diagnosis and rating of carpal instability have been clarified, and (7) criteria for diagnosis and rating of weakness not due to other ratable conditions have been clarified.
16.1 Principles of Assessment
16.1 a Principles of Impairment Evaluation Before using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides’ purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.

Methods for evaluating impairments of the upper extremities may be described as having anatomic, cosmetic, or functional bases. The physical evaluation determines the anatomic impairment and is based on the history and a detailed examination of the individual and the upper extremity(ies). The cosmetic evaluation concerns both the individual’s and society’s reaction to the individual’s condition. The functional evaluation measures the individual’s motor performance of activities of daily living or of a specific task within a set time frame. Functional studies are increasingly sophisticated and can complement the evaluation process. However, the necessary level of standardization in precision and reproducibility to assess function has not yet been developed to derive a numeric impairment rating.

Therefore, evaluation of anatomic impairment forms the basis for upper extremity assessment. The impairment ratings originally developed and retained in this chapter were developed to reflect the degree of impairment and its impact on the ability of the individual to perform activities of daily living.

The most practical and useful approach to evaluating impairment of a digit is to compare the current loss of function with the loss resulting from amputation. Total loss of motion and sensibility of a digit, or ankylosis with severe malposition that renders the digit essentially useless, is considered to be about the same as amputation of the part. Ankylosis of a digit or joint in the optimal functional position is given the least motion impairment of the part. Impairment due to total transverse sensory loss of a digit corresponds to 50% of the amputation impairment at the same length or level of involvement (Figures 16-6 and
16-7). Impairment values derived from amputation, loss of motion or ankylosis, and sensibility loss are combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).

16.1 b Impairment Evaluation: Documentation and Recording
The medical evaluation is the basis for determination of permanent anatomic impairment of the upper extremities. It must be accurate, objective, and well documented. Evaluation of the upper extremities requires a sound knowledge of the normal functional anatomy and would be incomplete without assessment of the general condition of the whole person.
It must be thorough and should include several elements: status of activities of daily living; careful observations; both local and general physical examinations; appropriate imaging evaluation; laboratory tests; and, preferably, a photographic record.

The Upper Extremities

An impairment evaluation is based on the examiner’s actual findings. A prior injury or illness is considered during assessment of causation and apportionment, as discussed in Chapters 1 and 2. Impairment ratings in this chapter have not been adjusted for hand dominance, as is done in Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System. Hand dominance is difficult to objectively measure and is not accounted for in these impairment ratings. Hand dominance may be right or left and may be marked or slight, or the individual may be completely ambidextrous. Hand dominance should be considered in the determination of disability. If the examiner believes that hand dominance has a significant impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living, this can be discussed in the impairment evaluation report along with the resulting impairment rating. Hand dominance may, of course, be significant when assessing disability.

A complete and detailed examination of the upper extremities is necessary for accurate impairment evaluation. One method for recording results from a systematic examination is the use of the Upper Extremity Impairment Evaluation Record (Figures 16-1a and 16-1b). Part 1 of the evaluation record addresses the hand region and lists impairments due to abnormal motion or ankylosis, amputation, and sensory loss resulting from digital nerve lesions and to other disorders. Part 2 is designed to assist impairment evaluation of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder due to abnormal motion or ankylosis, amputation, and “other” disorders, as well as those related to the peripheral nerve system, peripheral vascular system, and other disorders not included in regional impairments (eg, grip strength). Table 16-1 gives conversions from digit to hand impairment, and Table 16-2 gives those from hand to upper extremity impairment. Regional impairments resulting from the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder regions are combined to provide the upper extremity impairment (see Section 1.4, Philosophy and Use of the Combined Values Chart, and the Combined Values Chart, p. 604). The upper extremity impairment is then converted to a whole person impairment by means of Table 16-3.
-- chars 4010 --
When to add as opposed to combine impairments is discussed in Sections 16.1c and 16.1d and noted in Figure 16-1.

The impairment evaluation record form is designed for use with unilateral upper extremity impairments. Cases of bilateral involvement require completion of a separate record form for each upper extremity. The whole person impairment values derived for each upper extremity are then combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) to derive the total whole person impairment. If the total combined whole person impairment does not seem to adequately reflect the actual extent of alteration in the individual’s ability to perform activities of daily living, this should be noted.

• Combined Values Chart (p. 604).
If both limbs are involved, calculate the whole person impairment for each on a separate chart and combine the percents (Combined Values Chart).

16.1c Combining Impairment Ratings The method for combining various impairments is based on the principle that a second and each succeeding impairment do not apply to the whole unit (eg, whole finger) but only to the part or value that remains (eg, proximal phalanx) after the preceding impairment (eg, amputation through the proximal interphalangeal joint) has been applied.

When a given unit has more than one type of impairment (eg, abnormal motion, sensory loss, and partial amputation of a finger), the various impairments are combined to determine the total
impairment of the unit (eg, finger) before conversion to the next larger unit (eg, hand). Similarly, multiple regional impairments, such as those of the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder, are first expressed individually as upper extremity impairments and then combined to determine the total upper extremity impairment. The latter is finally converted to whole person impairment (Table 16-3). The combined value determination is based on the following formula: A% + B% (100% – A%) = the combined value of A% and B%.

The Combined Values Chart (p. 604) is used to determine the combined value of two impairment percentages. All percentages being combined must be expressed on a common denominator or same unit relative value. If three or more values are to be combined, the two lowest values are first selected and their combined value is found. The combined value and the third value are then combined to give the total value. This procedure can be repeated indefinitely, with the value obtained in each case being a combination of all the previous values.

4. For each unit of motion, the motion impairment value is found by adding together the two impairment values contributed by its components, based on the formula A% = E% + F%. Similarly, for each joint, the total motion impairment rating is found by adding the impairment values contributed by each unit of motion. For example, the upper extremity impairment due to abnormal elbow motion is found by adding the impairments from the flexion + extension (IE% + IF%) unit to those from the pronation + supination (IP% + IS%) unit, or total motion impairment equals (IF% + IE%) + (IP% + IS%).
-- chars 3261 --
5. In Section 16.7, Impairment of the Upper Extremities Due to Other Disorders, the relative value of each joint has been assigned on a 100% digit unit scale: thumb CMC 60%, MP 15%, and IP 25%; and finger MP 50%, PIP 30%, and DIP 20% (Table 16-18). However, the relative value scale used in Table 16-18 is not the same as that assigned for amputations (Table 16-4) and range of motion. Therefore, if more than one joint of a specific digit is affected by other disorders, the impairments are added directly together only in the absence of amputation and presence of full motion of each joint involved. Otherwise, they are combined.

All other upper extremity impairment ratings are combined.

It should be noted that, in terms of upper extremity impairment, the functional unit values for the shoulder (60%), elbow (70%), wrist (60%), and digital joints differ from those assigned for amputation at similar levels (Tables 16-4 and 16-18 and Section 16.4).

16.2 b Amputation Impairment: Levels Proximal to Digits
The amputation impairment ratings increase with progressively shorter stumps and reach 70% of the whole person for a scapulothoracic (forequarter) amputation, as illustrated in Figure 16-2 and noted in Table 16-4. Amputations through the humerus at or proximal to the deltoid tubercle level (approximately the axillary fold) correspond to 100% loss of the limb, or 60% impairment of the whole person.
Amputations occurring between a level just distal to the deltoid tubercle and the bicipital tuberosity

16.2  Amputations
16.2 a General Principles
Important factors to consider in evaluating amputations include not only the level of occurrence but also the presence of associated problems relating to the condition of the residual stump (Section 16.2d), to regional or central pain syndromes, and to restriction or loss of motion of existing proximal joints (Section 16.4).

The upper limb is considered as a unit of the whole person and is divided into shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand regions. The hand is further separated into digits and their parts. From distally to proximally, each anatomic unit is given a relative value to the next larger unit and, eventually, the whole person. By multiplying the appropriate percent, impairment of each unit can be converted sequentially to hand, upper extremity, and whole person impairment as indicated in Tables 16-1, 16-2, 16-3, and 16-4 and
Figures 16-2 and 16-3.

(insertion of the biceps brachii on the radius) constitute a 95% impairment of the upper extremity, or 57% impairment of the whole person. Amputations occurring between a level just distal to the bicipital tuberosity and the metacarpophalangeal joints of all digits are estimated to represent 94% to 90% impairment of the upper extremity (56% to 54% of the whole person) according to the functional possibilities afforded by either prosthetic or surgical options (eg, Krukenberg procedure), or simply by the actual length of the residual stump. The evaluator must use clinical judgment to select the appropriate values.

16.2 c Amputation Impairment: Digital Levels
Principles
Amputation of all digits (fingers and thumb) through the metacarpophalangeal joints removes the most essential parts of the hand and is considered 100% impairment of the hand, or 90% impairment of the

upper extremity. Since loss of the entire upper extremity represents 60% impairment of the whole person, this corresponds to 90% ? 60%, or 54% impairment of the whole person (Figures 16-2 and 16-3 and Tables 16-1 through 16-4).

Amputation through each joint level of a digit is given a relative value of loss to the entire digit as follows: digit metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint, 100%; thumb interphalangeal (IP) joint, 50%; finger proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, 80%; and finger distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, 45% (Figures 16-3, 16-4, and 16-5; Table 16-4). Digit impairment values for amputation at various levels are shown in Figures 16-4 (thumb) and 16-5 (fingers). Joints should be named rather than numbered.

Amputations of the thumb at levels proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint are considered to provide a greater severity of impairment than amputation at the MP joint level. Amputation through the thumb MP joint represents a 36% impairment of the upper extremity. Amputation through the distal third of the first metacarpal receives 37% impairment of the upper extremity, and amputation at or near the first carpometacarpal joint is given 38% impairment of the upper extremity (Table 16-4).

The digits represent five coordinated units into which hand function is unequally divided. Each digit is given a relative value to the entire hand as follows: thumb, 40%; index and middle fingers, 20% each; and ring and little fingers, 10% each (Figure 16-3;
Tables 16-1 and 16-4). To avoid confusion, digits are named rather than numbered.

By multiplying the appropriate percentages, the impairment rating for each digit, or portion thereof, is converted to an impairment rating of the larger units, the hand, the upper extremity, and, finally, the whole person (Tables 16-1 through 16-4).

a Clinical Evaluation
Evaluation of sensory function in the hand considers all modalities of sensibility, including perception of pain, warmth, cold, and touch-pressure, as well as vibration.

The grading system introduced by the Nerve Injuries Committee of the British Medical Research Council in 1954 describes six levels of sensory recovery after nerve injury. These levels are still used today to describe sensory changes:

S0
Absent sensibility
S1
Recovery of deep cutaneous pain and pressure sensibility (protective sensibility absent)
S2
Return of some degree of superficial cutaneous pain and tactile sensibility, and temperature appreciation (protective sensibility decreased)
-- chars 3133 --
S3
Return of superficial cutaneous pain and tactile sensibility (light touch diminished)
S3+ Some recovery of two-point discrimination S4
Complete sensory recovery

Generally, if an individual has some light touch recognition, the sensory submodalities are assumed to be present.

All clinical tests used to examine the degree of functional loss of sensibility are related to cutaneous touch-pressure sensation. At present, the two-point test for fine discrimination sensibility is most widely used, followed by the monofilament touch-pressure threshold test. The pinprick test can be useful to determine whether pain protective sensation is intact and to identify discrepancies between dermatomal findings and reported symptoms. More accurate assessment is obtained by using the sharp and dull sides of the pin at random. Vibration testing has yet to be associated with functional levels of sensibility.

The Ninhydrin sweat test and wrinkle test may be useful in documenting interruption of digital nerves, especially where questions exist concerning consistency between reported symptoms and neurologic findings. However, these tests have limitations in evaluating a recovering or compressed nerve, because they do not correlate with the presence or absence of sensibility in a regenerating nerve. The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament pressure aesthesiometer measures light-touch and deep-pressure thresholds with sufficient accuracy to quantify returning sensibility levels long before two-point discrimination is measurable. The moving two-point discrimination test may be useful in evaluating recovering nerve function because response to this stimulus returns before response to a static two-point stimulus. Functional isolation of the finger, as noted in the blindfolded picking-up test, can help determine the presence or absence of any useful sensibility in the digit.

The patterns of nerve loss and recovery seen in neuropathy or neuritis from disease or nerve compression are different from those following nerve lacerations. Within the limits of current instruments, two-point discrimination tests have been normal, whereas both the Semmes-Weinstein pressure aesthesiometer and nerve conduction studies have been abnormal in both clinical and induced neuropathies. Two-point discrimination has its widest application for individuals who have sustained nerve lacerations, in whom presence of two-point discrimination usually indicates significant return of function.

The classic Weber static two-point discrimination test is most valuable. Moberg originally described the use of a paper clip opened and bent into a caliper. The Disk-Criminator, DeMayo 2-Point Discrimination Device, and Boley Gauge are some of the currently available testing instruments. Testing is started distally and proceeds proximally. The distance between the tips of the instrument is set first at 5 mm. As the individual being tested closes his or her eyes, the tips of the testing device are applied lightly to the sides of the pulp of the distal segment of the digit in a random sequence, in a longitudinal orientation. Because it is light-touch discrimination that is being tested, the pressure applied should be very light and must not produce a point of blanching or skin indentation. The interval between applications should be no less than 3 to 5 seconds. A series of touches with one or two
-- chars 3386 --
points is made, and the individual immediately indicates whether one or two points are felt. Two out of three responses must be accurate for scoring. The distance between the ends is progressively increased until the required accurate responses are elicited, at which time the distance is recorded.

Sensibility assessment is one of the most challenging tasks in impairment evaluation. The subjective nature of sensibility testing can relate to a number of variables involving the testing environment, the individual being tested, the test instruments and methods of administration, and the examiner. Tests should be administered in a quiet environment void of extraneous noises that distract the individual and the tester. Examinee-related variables can include attitude, concentration, anxiety, and the like. Abnormal skin texture, such as calluses, also influences the test results. Instrument-related variables include manufacturing quality control, readjustment of calibration as needed over time, and the weight of various instruments.
Important method-related variables include rate and duration of stimulus application, the amount of pressure exerted on the skin, and whether the stimulus is moving or constant. Instruments designed to control the force and velocity of two-point or monofilament application and of other stimuli are not yet available. The examiner’s experience, attention to detail, and adherence to methods of administration can minimize the effects of the above variables.

16.3 b Digital Nerve Sensory Impairment Evaluation: Principles
Only unequivocal and permanent sensory deficits are given permanent impairment ratings. Sensory impairment is rated according to the sensory quality and the distribution of the sensory loss.

The sensory quality is based on the results of the
two-point discrimination test carried out over the distal palmar area of the digit, or on the most distal part of the stump in the presence of a partial amputation. Sensibility defects on the dorsal surfaces of the digits are not considered impairing. The sensory quality impairment is classified according to Table 16-5.
In total sensory losses (>15 mm), the response to touch, pinprick, pressure, and vibratory stimuli is absent. In partial sensory losses (7-15 mm), there is poor localization and abnormal response to the sensory stimuli.

Total transverse sensory loss impairments correspond to 50% of amputation values.

The sensory quality impairment ratings derived from Table 16-5 are to be used only for impairment due to lesions of digital nerves. They cannot be used in Table 16-10 as a substitute for selecting the grade of severity of sensory deficits or pain resulting from peripheral nerve disorders. Values from Table 16-5 are not to be used as severity index multipliers in

nerves (Table 16-13), brachial plexus (Table 16-14), or major peripheral nerves (Table 16-15).

The distribution, or area, of sensory loss is determined by the level of involvement (percentage of digit length affected) of either both digital nerves (transverse sensory loss) or one digital nerve on either the radial or ulnar side of the digit (longitudinal sensory loss). The percentage of digit length involved is derived from the top scale of Figure 16-6 for the thumb and of Figure 16-7 for the fingers.

16.3 c Rating Impairment Due to Digital Neuromas
The grade of severity of pain and decreased function associated with neuromas of the digital nerves is rated according to Table 16-10a. The severity grade percentage is multiplied by the maximum impairment value of the digital nerve involved (see Table 16-10b, Procedure). The maximum digit impairment values for each digital nerve are found in Table 16-6 for the thumb and little finger and Table 16-7 for the index, middle, and ring fingers under the columns headed Longitudinal Loss, Total (Ulnar or Radial),
16.3
d Digital Nerve Sensory Impairment Determination Method
1. Use the two-point discrimination test to identify the sensory quality, or type of sensory loss, as total (> 15 mm) or partial (7 through 15 mm) (Table 16-5).
2. Determine the distribution of sensory loss involvement or whether one (longitudinal sensory loss) or both (transverse sensory loss) digital nerves are involved.
3. Identify the level of involvement, or percentage of digit length involved, using the top scale of Figure 16-6 for the thumb and of Figure 16-7 for the fingers.
-- chars 3105 --
4. Consult Table 16-6 for the thumb and little finger and Table 16-7 for the index, middle, and ring fingers to determine the digit impairment for either total or partial, transverse or longitudinal (ulnar or radial) sensory loss according to the percentage of digit length involved.
5. If both digital nerves are involved in the same digit, the sensory impairments relating to the ulnar or radial palmar nerves are added.
6. Convert the digit impairment to hand, upper extremity, and whole person impairment by using Tables 16-1, 16-2, and 16-3. When a digit has more than one impairment, obtain the total digit impairment value by combining its various impairments before converting the digit values to a hand value.

In assessing motion, the examiner should first observe what an individual can and cannot do by asking him or her to move each joint of the extremity, from the shoulder down, through its full range of motion. Both extremities should be compared. Individual joints are then evaluated separately. Similarly, movements of the digits are first evaluated as a unit by having the individual make a complete fist and then extend the digits fully over several repetitions. In determining the range of motion of individual joints, the examiner must evaluate both the active and the passive motion. Active or voluntary motion is that performed by the active con-
traction of the governing muscles and is evaluated first. When a person has full active joint excursion, passive motion values need not to be taken because a joint that has full active excursion will have a full passive range as well. However, if the active arc of motion is incomplete, assisted active and/or passive motion measurements are necessary to evaluate the joint motion.
Passive motion is that produced by an external force to determine the freedom and range of motion existing at a joint when all muscles are relaxed. An example,
is Bunnell’s test for intrinsic tightness in the hand. Assisted active motion is the result of active muscle contraction and an external force applied to the joint; it allows for stabilization of a segment to improve the mechanical advantage of the muscles that move the joint being measured. In both cases, approximately 0.5 kg of force is applied while a segment of the joint is stabilized. Measurements of active motion take precedence in the Guides. The actual measured goniometer readings or linear measurements are recorded.

Many different factors can limit the normal range of motion of the joints of the upper extremities.
Limitation of active motion can be due to failure of the nerve, muscle, or tendon to execute the motion. Limitation of passive motion can be from involvement of the joint itself, a fixed contracture, or the antagonistic muscle or tendon that holds back the motion because it is adherent or too short. Sound clinical knowledge and measurement techniques are necessary for appropriate impairment evaluation and rating.
-- chars 3121 --
Digital joints are measured with the wrist held in neutral position and the forearm pronated. To measure the ROM of individual joints, the proximal joint(s) are stabilized in extension, and only the joint being measured is flexed. Note that if all three joints are flexed simultaneously, as in making a fist, active flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint will be decreased. In some cases of decreased finger motion due to limited excursion of the activating musculotendinous unit or blockage of motion by the antagonistic musculotendinous unit, the measurement of individual joints, as described earlier, can be normal or near normal. In these situations, the total active range of motion (TAM) of the digit is measured.
Flexion of each joint is measured while all three joints are held in a position of maximum active flexion, or the finger is flexed as a whole unit; similarly, extension of each joint is measured while all three joints are held in maximum extension. The methods used to derive motion impairment of a digit using individual joint measurements and the total active range of motion of a digit are different, as explained on p. 465, Combining Abnormal Motion at More Than One Finger Joint. The joint measurement technique that best reflects the existing impairment is selected.

16.4 b Principle for Motion Impairment Calculation: A = E + F
The arc of motion is the total number of degrees of excursion measured between the two extreme angles of a plane of motion of a joint, for example, from maximum extension to maximum flexion. When there is complete loss of joint motion, or ankylosis, the total number of degrees of lost motion (A) equals the sum of lost extension degrees (E) and lost flexion degrees (F), or A = E + F. A always equals the total number of degrees of the normal arc of motion.

The symbol V represents the measured angle. The measured angle of extension is represented by Vext, and the measured angle of flexion is represented by Vflex. Assuming that a joint, which normally has a range of motion of 0° extension to 90° flexion, has a measured Vext at 0° and Vflex at 90°, then there is no loss of motion.

When the joint flexion is decreased, F (lost flexion degrees) equals the theoretically largest Vflex minus the measured Vflex. For example, if a joint that would normally flex to 90° has a measured Vflex at 60°:
F = 90° – 60° = 30° flexion loss.

When joint extension is decreased, E (lost extension degrees) equals the measured Vext minus the theoretically smallest Vext. For example, if a joint that would normally extend to 0° has an extension lag measured at Vext 20°: E = 20° – 0° = 20° extension loss.

With decreasing flexion, Vflex decreases, and with increasing extension loss, Vext increases; as motion is lost, these values will finally meet at the same point on the arc of motion, or Vflex will equal Vext. When this occurs, there is ankylosis, or total loss of the potential arc of motion degrees (A). For example,
if a joint that would normally extend to 0° and flex to 90° is ankylosed at 40°: Vext = Vflex = 40°; E = 40° – 0° = 40°; F = 90° – 40° = 50°;
-- chars 3129 --
A = 40° (E) + 50° (F), or 90°; and there is total loss of the potential full arc of motion.

Impairment of finger motion may be due to loss of extension (E) with or without loss of flexion (F) or to ankylosis (A). The restricted motion impairment percents are called IE%, IF%, and IA%, respectively, and are functions of the angle (V) measured at examination.

IE% = 0% when Vext reaches its smallest theoretical value.
IF% = 0% when Vflex reaches its largest theoretical value.
IA% = IE% + IF% when Vext= Vflex.

The formula A% = E% + F% can also be written
E% = A% – F%; therefore, impairment values for lack of extension (IE%) can be derived for any measured extension angle on the basis that IE% = IA% – IF%.
The derivation of both IE% and IF% allows estimation of impairment percentages relating not only to the number of degrees of lost motion but, most important, to the location of the loss on the arc of motion.

Motion impairment curves based on the formula A% = E% + F% were derived on a 100% scale for each motion unit of each upper extremity joint, tak-
ing into consideration the functional position of each joint as recommended in the literature for fusion (eg, Figure 16-11). The value of A% reaches its maximum, or 100%, at the two extreme positions of the arc of motion and drops to its lowest percent when the angle of ankylosis corresponds to the position of function of the joint. The motion impairment curves plotted on a 100% motion unit scale were converted to pie charts of regional motion impairment (thumb, finger, upper extremity) by applying the relative regional value of each respective motion unit as a conversion factor (eg, Figure 16-12).

For example, wrist functional unit = 60% of upper extremity function. Flexion/extension unit = 70% of wrist function unit, or 70% ? 60% = 42% of upper extremity function. Radial/ulnar deviation unit = 30% of wrist functional unit, or 30% ? 60% = 18% of upper extremity function. The flexion/extension motion unit impairment curve (Figure 16-27) was multiplied by 42% to derive the pie chart of upper extremity impairment (Figure 16-28) resulting from restricted wrist flexion/extension. The radial/ulnar deviation motion unit impairment curve (Figure
16-30) was multiplied by 18% to obtain the pie chart of upper extremity impairment (Figure 16-31) resulting from restricted wrist lateral deviation.

16.4 c Method for Motion Impairment Calculation
The motion impairment pie charts are used for motion impairment calculation of a specific joint. Because the same relative value scale is applied to each motion unit and to its components, the impairment values derived for each are added directly together to obtain the total motion impairment of a specific joint. The total impairment value of a motion unit is obtained by adding the impairment values contributed by its two component movements (eg, impairment of flexion/extension motion unit = IF% + IE%). Similarly, when a joint has more than one unit of motion (eg, elbow flexion/extension and pronation/supination), its total motion impairment is obtained by adding the impairment values contributed by each unit of motion. When a joint that has a single unit of motion (eg, MP joint) is ankylosed, IA% represents its motion impairment. When a joint that has more than one unit of motion (eg, the elbow) is ankylosed, the ankylosis impairments (IA%) derived for each motion unit are added to obtain its total motion impairment.

Adding Two or More Abnormal Thumb Motions
1. Measure and record the thumb impairments of flexion and extension at the IP and MP joints (Figures 16-12 and 16-15), radial abduction and adduction (Table 16-8a), adduction (Table 16-8b), and opposition (Table 16-9) as described above.
2. Add the impairment values contributed by each motion unit to determine the total thumb impairment due to abnormal motion.

Because the relative value of each unit of motion to the entire thumb ray was taken into consideration in the thumb impairment charts and tables, the thumb impairments resulting from abnormal motion are added directly together. If each thumb unit of motion were impaired to its maximum value, the total thumb motion impairment would add to 100%. Note that when more than one finger joint is involved, the impairment values are combined because the relative value of each finger joint (DIP, PIP, MP) was not assigned on a 100% finger unit scale.
16.4e Finger Motion Impairment
-- chars 3019 --
The fingers have three functional units of motion, each having the same relative functional value as that found in amputation impairment: DIP, 45%; PIP, 80%; and MP, 100% (Table 16-4).

For each joint, unit-of-motion impairment curves were derived according to the basic formula, A = E + F, and converted to pie charts of finger impairment values by applying the relative value of each functional unit as a conversion factor (Figures 16-21,
16-23, and 16-25).

In the normal hand, the MP joint can hyperextend usefully to 20°; a small percentage of extension impairment has been assigned to loss of hyperextension, or IE% = 5% at 0° extension (Figure 16-25). The PIP and DIP joints normally extend to 0°, and IE% equals 0% at this angle; between the angles of 0° extension and
+30° hyperextension, impairment values are given for lack of flexion and not for hyperextension.
Consideration for positions of hyperextension allows one to rate impairment of flexion or ankylosis for angles above the 0° neutral position. For example, ankylosis of the PIP joint in 30° hyperextension equals 80% finger impairment (Figure 16-23). Note that, for each joint, the ankylosis impairment value is at its lowest for the angle of functional position.

The actual range-of-motion measurements are recorded and applied to the various impairment pie charts. Impairment values for motion measurements falling between those shown in a pie chart may be adjusted or interpolated proportionally in the corresponding interval.

The techniques for clinical measurement of motion of the digital joints are described in Section 16.4a. Two methods are presented: (1) measurement of individual joints with the proximal joints stabilized in extension and (2) measurement of the total active range of motion of the digit while all three joints are flexed simultaneously. The joint measurement technique that best reflects the existing impairment is selected.

DIP Joint: Flexion and Extension
The DIP joint has a normal motion of 0° extension to 70° flexion. The functional position is 20° flexion.
The relative value of this motion unit is 45% of the finger.

and record the actual goniometer readings (Figure 16-20).
2. Using Figure 16-21, match the measured angles (row headed V) of flexion and extension to their corresponding impairments of flexion (row headed IF%) and extension (row headed IE%).

Flexion and Extension
The normal range of motion is considered to be from 140° flexion to 0° extension. The position of function is 80° flexion. The relative value of this motion unit is 42% of the upper extremity function.

2. In Figure 16-34, match the measured flexion and extension angles (row headed V) to their corresponding impairments of flexion (row headed IF%) and extension (row headed IE%). Impairment values for angles falling between those listed in Figure 16-34 may be adjusted or interpolated proportionally in the corresponding interval.

Ankylosis in the functional position (80° flexion) is given the lowest IA%, or 50% of this motion unit value (Figure 16-33). This corresponds to 21% impairment of the upper extremity (Figure 16-34). Ankylosis in either 0° extension or 140° flexion represents a 100% loss of elbow flexion and extension function (Figure 16-33). This is equivalent to 60% impairment of elbow function and 42% impairment (60% ? 70%) of the upper extremity due to loss of this elbow motion unit (Figure 16-34).

Ankylosis in functional position (80° flexion) is given the lowest IA% value (50%).

Use Table 16-3 to relate the impairment of the upper extremity to impairment of the whole
16.5a Impairment Evaluation Principles The evaluation of permanent impairment resulting from peripheral nerve disorders is based on the anatomic distribution and severity of loss of function resulting from (1) sensory deficits or pain and
(2) motor deficits and loss of power. Characteristic deformities and manifestations resulting from peripheral nerve lesions, such as restricted motion, atrophy, and vasomotor, trophic, and reflex changes, have been taken into consideration in the estimated impairment values shown in this section. Therefore, when an impairment results strictly from a peripheral nerve lesion, in the absence of CRPS, the motion impairment values derived from Section 16.4 are not applied to this section to avoid duplication or unwarranted increase in the impairment estimation. For example, the claw hand deformity of MP joint hyperextension and IP joint flexion of the ring and little fingers is a classic manifestation of an ulnar nerve lesion; in absence of CRPS II/causalgia, the impairment value for motor deficit of the ulnar nerve is derived according to this section and applied without assigning additional impairment for loss of motion. However, if restricted motion cannot be attributed strictly to a peripheral nerve lesion, such as would be the case in CRPS I/RSD, the motion impairment values are evaluated separately according to Section
16.4 and then combined (Combined Values Chart,
p. 604) with the peripheral nerve system impairment value derived from this section.

16.5b Impairment Evaluation Methods The upper extremity impairment is calculated by multiplying the grade of severity of the sensory deficit (Table 16-10a) and/or of the motor deficit (Table 16-11a) by the respective maximum upper extremity impairment value resulting from sensory and/or motor deficits of each nerve structure involved, as listed in Section 16.5c, Regional Impairment Determination: spinal nerves, Table 1613; brachial plexus, Table 16-14; and major peripheral nerves, Table 16-15. When both sensory and motor functions are involved, the impairment values derived for each are combined (Combined Values Chart, p. 604). The steps of the impairment determination method are detailed below.
-- chars 3065 --
The origins and functions of the peripheral nerves that serve the upper extremities are summarized in Table 16-12. The motor innervation of the upper extremity is shown in Figure 16-47. The cutaneous innervation and related nerves are shown in Figure 16-48, the dermatomes of the upper extremities in Figure 16-49, and a schematic diagram of the brachial plexus in Figure 16-50.

Impairment Determination Method
Use the following method to evaluate the impairment resulting from each peripheral nerve structure:

1. If sensory deficits or pain is present, localize the distribution and relate it to the nerve structure involved (Table 16-12 and Figures 16-48, 16-49,
and 16-50).
2. If motor deficits or loss of power is present, identify the key muscles involved and relate the motor deficit to the nerve structure(s) involved (Table 16-12 and Figures 16-47 and 16-50).
3. Grade the severity of sensory deficits or pain according to Table 16-10a and/or that of the motor deficits according to Table 16-11a.
4. Find the values for maximum impairment of the upper extremity due to sensory and/or motor deficits of the nerve structure involved: individual spinal nerve (Table 16-13), brachial plexus (Table 16-14), and major peripheral nerves (Table 16-15).
5. For each nerve structure involved, multiply the grade of severity of the sensory and/or motor deficits (see step 3 above) by the appropriate maximum upper extremity impairment value (see step 4 above) to determine the upper extremity impairment percent for each function.
6.
For a structure with mixed motor and sensory fibers, determine the upper extremity impairment for each function (steps 1 through 5), then combine the sensory and motor impairment percents (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment value.
7. When more than one nerve structure is involved, combine their respective upper extremity impairment values (steps 1 through 5) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment resulting from peripheral nerve disorders (Combined Values Chart).
8. When multiple impairments of the extremity are present because of amputation, loss of motion that is not strictly attributed to a peripheral nerve lesion, or peripheral vascular disorders, combine the peripheral nerve upper extremity impairment value with the other upper extremity impairment values (Combined Values Chart) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment.
9. The total upper extremity impairment is converted to a whole person impairment by means of Table 16-3.
10. If there is bilateral upper extremity involvement, determine separately the impairment values for each side, and convert them to whole person impairment. Combine the whole person impairment values for each side (Combined Values Chart) to obtain the total whole person impairment. Consult page 435 for further comments on bilateral upper extremity involvement.

Grading Sensory Deficits or Pain
-- chars 3031 --
A wide range of abnormal sensations may be associated with peripheral nerve lesions, including diminished sensation (anesthesia or hypesthesia), abnormal sensation (dysesthesia or paresthesia), and increased sensation (hyperesthesia). Another possible manifestation is pain of various types, including pain resulting from nonnoxious stimulus (allodynia), overreactive pain (hyperpathia), a state of dysesthetic pain (deafferentation), and, most significantly, the sustained, burning pain present in CRPS I (RSD)
and CRPS II (causalgia). Cold intolerance may also be present.

Sensory deficits or pain associated with peripheral nerve disorders are evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) How does the sensory deficit or pain interfere with the individual’s performance of daily activities? (2) To what extent does the sensory deficit or pain follow the defined anatomic pathways of the spinal nerves, brachial plexus, or peripheral nerves? (3) To what extent is the description of the sensory deficit or pain consistent with characteristics of peripheral nerve disorders? (4) To what extent does the sensory deficit or pain correspond to other disturbances (motor, trophic, vasomotor, etc) of the involved nerve structure?

The methods for clinical assessment of sensibility are detailed in Section 16.3. In individuals with nerve lacerations, the presence of two-point discrimination usually indicates significant return of function. However, in conditions such as radiculitis, causalgia, and entrapment or compression neuropathy, normal two-point discrimination does not exclude the presence of abnormal light-touch/deeppressure thresholds and abnormal conduction studies. Conversely, the presence of a normal light-touch threshold does not necessarily indicate that two-point discrimination is normal in these cases. The use of the Semmes-Weinstein touch-pressure threshold monofilament test may be a helpful adjunct to the two-point discrimination test to help assess changes in light-touch sensibility.

Upper extremity impairments due to sensory deficits or pain resulting from peripheral nerve disorders are determined according to the grade of severity in diminution or loss of function and the relative maximum upper extremity impairment value of the nerve structure involved, as shown in the classification
(a) and procedural (b) steps described in Table 16-10 and the impairment determination method detailed in Section 16.5b. Table 16-10 provides a classification for determining impairment of the upper extremity due to a sensory deficit or pain resulting from a nerve disorder. This table is to be used for pain that is due to nerve injury or disease that has been documented with objective physical findings or electrodiagnostic abnormalities. It is not to be used for pain in the distribution of a nerve that has not been injured except in diagnosed cases of complex regional pain syndromes. The examiner must use clinical judgment to estimate the appropriate percentage of sensory deficits or pain within the range of values shown for each severity grade. The maximum value for each grade is not applied automatically.

• Spinal nerves C5 to C8 and T1
• Brachial plexus
• Major peripheral nerves

Spinal Nerves
Evaluating impairment of the spinal nerves due to injuries or disease is based on the severity of loss of function of the peripheral nerves receiving fibers from specific spinal nerves. Because each spinal nerve transmits fibers to more than one peripheral nerve, the loss of function is greater with the involvement of two or more spinal nerves transmitting fibers

to the same peripheral nerve than with the involvement of a single spinal nerve. Therefore, in multiple spinal nerve involvement, the impairment is evaluated according to the brachial plexus values (Table 16-14) rather than combining the individual spinal nerve values shown in Table 16-13.

Motor deficit calculation:
1. Muscle involved: deltoid, which is innervated by the axillary nerve (Table 16-12 and Figure 16-47).
2. Severity of motor deficit: grade 4 (1%-25%) (Table 16-11a). A severity rating of 25% was selected on clinical judgment because of the severity of the weakness.
3. Maximum upper extremity impairment due to motor deficit of the axillary nerve: 35% (Table 16-15).
4. Multiply the maximum upper extremity impairment for motor deficit of the axillary nerve (35%) by the severity of motor deficit (25%) to obtain the impairment of the upper extremity due to motor deficit of the axillary nerve, or 35% ? 25% = 9%.
Impairment Rating: Combined sensory and motor deficits: Combine 9% upper extremity motor deficit with 1% upper extremity sensory deficit (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to obtain 10% upper extremity impairment resulting from axillary nerve dysfunction. This corresponds to 6% whole person impairment (Table 16-3).

For example, the maximum upper extremity impairment due to combined motor and sensory deficits resulting from a lesion of the upper trunk (C5 and C6) is 81% (Table 16-14); however, combining the impairment values of the individual nerves C5 (34%) and C6 (40%), as shown in Table 16-13, results in 60% upper extremity impairment (Combined Values Chart, p. 604), which does not reflect the full severity of loss of function.
-- chars 3074 --
Table 16-13 provides maximum upper extremity impairment values for unilateral sensory and motor deficits of the spinal nerves that are most frequently involved. A spinal nerve–related impairment is determined according to the method detailed in Section
16.5b. Impairment of a specific spinal nerve that is not mentioned in this section should be estimated by considering the percents suggested for a nerve that has fibers from the specific spinal nerve. Bilateral involvements are discussed in the Impairment Determination Method (Section 16.5b), step 10.

Brachial Plexus
The brachial plexus innervates the shoulder girdle and upper extremity and is formed by the anterior primary divisions of the fifth through eighth cervical roots and the first thoracic root. These roots anastomose to form three primary trunks: upper trunk (C5 and C6), middle trunk (C7), and lower trunk (C8 and T1) (Figure 16-50). Specific findings result from the involvement of these structures.

Entrapment neuropathy is a nerve compression–type lesion that implies disproportion between the volume of the peripheral nerve and the space through which it passes. The underlying causes may be intrinsic or extrinsic, in that the nerve itself or the other contents of the passage may be enlarged or the passage space may be narrowed. The differential diagnosis of entrapment neuropathy is extensive. The local causes can relate to specific anatomic variations in the configuration of bones or soft tissue resulting from chronic irritation or an inflammatory process such as tenosynovitis; mechanical causes such as blunt trauma, fractures, or scarring; or congenital anomalies such as aberrant muscles, arteries, or a cervical rib in the thoracic outlet region. Neoplastic conditions, such as myeloma or neurofibromatosis, or space-occupying lesions, such as ganglion, lipoma, or fibroma, must be ruled out. Predisposing or associated conditions can include diabetes, arthritis, alcoholism, renal disease, hormonal changes, malnutrition, or obesity.

† See Table 16-11a to grade motor deficits.

Fourth ed. Chicago, Ill: American Medical Association; 1993.

Peripheral nerves can become compressed at any level from the hand to the thoracocervical region. One nerve can be trapped simultaneously at two levels, or more than one nerve can be trapped. Certain anatomic constraints make particular nerves at specific sites more vulnerable, leading to well-defined patterns or syndromes. Generally, each nerve lesion can be described clinically as a high or a low lesion, that is, a high or a low median, radial, or ulnar lesion. The most frequently encountered entrapment is of the median nerve at the wrist, leading to the carpal tunnel syndrome, followed by the ulnar nerve at the elbow. The recurrent motor branch of the median nerve can be involved singly or in combination with the median nerve at the wrist. Knowledge
-- chars 3582 --
of normal and variant anatomy, both gross and microscopic, is essential for accurate diagnosis and precise localization of the lesion.

Diagnosis of Entrapment/Compression Neuropathy
The diagnosis of entrapment/compression neuropathy is based on (1) the history and symptoms;
(2) objective clinical signs and findings on detailed examination; and (3) documentation by electroneuromyographic studies. Standard roentgenograms and more involved imaging studies are also useful.

The history should include a listing of occupation(s), activities of daily living, factors that alleviate or aggravate the symptoms, medical conditions, and past surgical procedures or trauma. The entrapment of a major peripheral nerve or one of its branches is reflected by a disturbance of a specific motor, sensory, or autonomic function. Functionally, the symptoms may vary from slight paresthesia, motor weakness, or both to complete sensibility loss, muscle paralysis, or both. The severity of the nerve damage and symptoms depends on the duration, magnitude, and type of compression as well as on the microanatomy of the nerve involved.

The physical examination evaluates sensibility alterations, muscle power, range of motion, grip strength, and tendon reflexes. Increased pressure over an entrapped nerve, or its irritation by tapping or stretching, is reflected by paresthesia (sensation of electrical shock) in its autonomous zone and possibly by limitation of motion because of pain. Individuals with compression neuropathies show different patterns of loss and recovery than individuals with lacerations. They may have normal two-point discrimination but abnormal light-touch/deep-pressure recognition. SemmesWeinstein monofilament testing can be indicated in these cases. Provocative tests are helpful to induce clinical symptoms; these include, for example, the tourniquet, Phalen’s or reverse Phalen’s, elbow flexion, and Adson’s tests. Nerve percussion tests are performed distal to proximal and then directly over the area of a sensitive cutaneous or major mixed nerve.
Testing of Tinel’s sign should be reserved for regenerating nerves to document the progress and speed of axon regeneration after repair of a lacerated nerve or decompression of a severely compressed nerve.

The electroneurodiagnostic examination includes electromyographic (needle and cutaneous) examinations, which evaluate only motor unit potentials, and motor and sensory nerve conduction studies. These procedures assess only the largest, most heavily myelinated axons; the lightly myelinated and unmyelinated axons that transmit pain are not directly evaluated. A fundamental point is that, regardless of the cause of nerve damage, the electrodiagnostic studies essentially can detect only two types of pathophysiology of the peripheral nerve system fibers: (1) axon loss (axonotmetic lesion), which is manifested as conduction failure, and (2) focal demyelination (neuropraxic lesion), which can cause either conduction slowing or conduction block, depending on the severity of the process. The severity of conduction slowing has no correlation with the severity of clinical symptoms, such as weakness or static large-fiber sensory loss. If these are present, substantial amounts of either conduction block, axon loss, or a combination of both must be present.
-- chars 3333 --
Impairment Rating of Entrapment/Compression Neuropathies Only individuals with an objectively verifiable diag-
nosis should qualify for a permanent impairment rating. The diagnosis is made not only on believable symptoms but, more important, on the presence of positive clinical findings and loss of function. The diagnosis should be documented by electromyography as well as sensory and motor nerve conduction studies. However, it is critical to understand that there is no correlation between the severity of conduction delay on nerve conduction velocity testing and the severity of either symptoms or, more important, impairment rating. The surgical findings of evidence of nerve compression and reactive hyperemia upon nerve release help confirm the diagnosis.

Postoperatively, a sufficient amount of time for optimal physiologic recovery and rehabilitation should elapse before an individual qualifies for permanent impairment rating should there be residual symptoms or clinical findings. Factors affecting nerve recovery in compression lesions include nerve fiber pathology, level of injury, duration of injury, and status of the end organs. Age is not a prognostic factor. Sensory function usually returns before motor function. High axonotmetic lesions may take 1 to 2 years for maximal recovery, whereas even lesions at the wrist may take 6 to 9 months for maximal recovery of nerve function. During the recovery time, individuals can experience some of the preoperative symptoms. An advancing Tinel’s sign can be monitored and is a good prognostic sign.

The sensory deficits or pain, and/or the motor deficits and loss of power, are evaluated according to the impairment determination method described in Section 16.5b. Sensory impairments strictly due to lesions of digital nerves are evaluated according to Section 16.3. In compression neuropathies, additional impairment values are not given for decreased grip strength. In the absence of CRPS, additional impairment values are not given for decreased motion. In the presence of associated CRPS II (causalgia), the compression neuropathy is evaluated according to the principles of CRPS II described in Section 16.5e.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
The carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common of nerve compression lesions and involves the median nerve at the volar aspect of the wrist. There are many presentations of CTS. Pain and paresthesias in the median nerve distribution of the hand are the usual symptoms. Pain may radiate proximally. Nocturnal paresthesias, relieved by shaking the hand, are frequently reported and can be the only symptom in the earliest stages of nerve pathology. True sensory disturbances and muscle atrophy represent later stages, when axonotmesis with axonal degeneration is also present. The symptoms, signs, and findings may include sensory or autonomic disturbances of the radial 31/2 digits, weakness or atrophy of the thenar muscles, a positive percussion sign at the wrist, presence of Phalen’s sign, and motor and sensory electroneuromyographic abnormalities. Not all symptoms are necessarily present in any one case. In isolated involvement of the recurrent branch of the median nerve, there is weakness of thumb abduction and thenar atrophy without any sensory disturbance in the hand. Sensitivity to cold may be a major presenting symptom of CTS. Certain cases may be associated with reflex dystrophy (CRPS I). It has also been reported that 5% of individuals with CTS may have normal electrophysiologic studies.
-- chars 3522 --
If, after an optimal recovery time following surgical decompression, an individual continues to complain of pain, paresthesias, and/or difficulties in performing certain activities, three possible scenarios can be present:

1. Positive clinical findings of median nerve dysfunction and electrical conduction delay(s): the impairment due to residual CTS is rated according to the sensory and/or motor deficits as described earlier.
2. Normal sensibility and opposition strength with abnormal sensory and/or motor latencies or abnormal EMG testing of the thenar muscles: a residual CTS is still present, and an impairment rating not to exceed 5% of the upper extremity may be justified.
3. Normal sensibility (two-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing), opposition strength, and nerve conduction studies: there is no objective basis for an impairment rating.

16.5e Complex Regional Pain Syndromes (CRPS), Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (CRPS I), and Causalgia (CRPS II)
The hallmark of these syndromes is a characteristic burning pain that is present without stimulation or movement, that occurs beyond the territory of a single peripheral nerve, and that is disproportionate to the inciting event. The pain is associated with specific clinical findings, including signs of vasomotor and sudomotor dysfunction and, later, trophic changes of all tissues from skin to bone.

Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction was thought to be involved in the generation of the symptoms and signs; hence, the term reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Causalgia was considered similar to RSD except, unlike RSD, it followed a lesion of a peripheral nerve, either of a major mixed nerve in the proximal extremity (major causalgia) or of a purely sensory branch more distally (minor causalgia). A recent reconsideration of these syndromes has generated new terminology and ideas concerning the underlying pathophysiology. The International Association for the Study of Pain has proposed the term complex regional pain syndromes, which has replaced the term RSD with CRPS I and causalgia with CRPS II. The most important difference from earlier opinions is that sympathetic dysfunction is not assumed to be the underlying basis for the symptoms and signs of CRPS. It is felt that sympathetically maintained pain is not an essential component of CRPS, as it may be present in a variety of painful conditions, including or independent of CRPS. Contrary to previous suggestions, regional sympathetic blockade has no role in the diagnosis of CRPS.

Since a subjective complaint of pain is the hallmark of these conditions, and many of the associated physical signs and radiologic findings can be the result of disuse, the differential diagnosis is extensive; it includes somatoform pain disorder, somatoform conversion disorder, factitious disorder, and malingering. Consequently, the approach to the diagnosis of these syndromes should be conservative and based on objective findings. The criteria listed in Table 16-16 predicate a diagnosis of CRPS upon a preponderance of objective findings that can be identified during a standard physical examination and demonstrated by radiologic techniques. At least eight of these findings must be present concurrently for a diagnosis of CRPS. Signs are objective evidence of disease perceptible to the examiner, as opposed to symptoms, which are subjective sensations of the individual.

CRPS I (RSD) Impairment Determination
In CRPS I, neither the initiating causative factor nor the symptoms involve a specific peripheral nerve structure or territory. The impairment determination is derived as follows:

1. Rate the upper extremity impairment resulting from loss of motion of each individual joint involved (Section 16.4).
2. Rate the upper extremity impairment resulting from sensory deficits and pain according to the grade that best describes the severity of interference with activities of daily living as described in Table 16-10a. Use clinical judgment to select the appropriate severity grade and the appropriate percentage from within the range shown in each grade. The maximum value is not automatically applied. The value selected represents the upper extremity impairment. A nerve value multiplier is not used.
3. Combine the upper extremity value for loss of joint motion (step 1) and pain and sensory deficits (step 2) to determine the upper extremity impairment due to CRPS I (Combined Values Chart,
p. 604).
4. Convert the upper extremity impairment to whole person impairment by using Table 16-3.

In contrast to CRPS II, impairment values for sensory and motor deficits of a specific nerve structure cannot be applied. No additional impairment is assigned for decreased pinch or grasp strength. The impairment rating method described for sensory deficits due to lesions of digital nerves is not applied in CRPS.

CRPS II (Causalgia) Impairment Determination
In CRPS II, a specific sensory or mixed nerve structure is involved. The impairment determination is derived as follows:

1. Rate the upper extremity impairment due to loss of motion of each individual joint involved (Section 16.4).
2. Rate the upper extremity impairment resulting from sensory deficits and pain of the injured nerves according to the determination methods described in Section 16.5b and Table 16-10a. Use clinical judgment to select the appropriate severity grade and the appropriate percentage from within the range shown in each grade.

3. Rate the upper extremity impairment resulting from motor deficits and loss of power of the injured nerve according to the determination method described in Section 16.5b and Table 16-11a.
4. Combine the upper extremity impairment percents for loss of joint motion (step 1), pain and sensory deficits (step 2), and motor deficits (step 3), if present, to determine the upper extremity impairment (Combined Values Chart, p. 604). Severe CRPS II may result in complete loss of function and in impairment of the extremity as great as 100%.
5. Convert the upper extremity impairment to whole person impairment by using Table 16-3.

No additional impairment is given for decreased pinch or grip strength. The impairment rating method described for sensory deficits resulting from lesions of digital nerves is not applied in CRPS.

16.6 Impairment of the Upper Extremities Due to Vascular

orders
The criteria for evaluating Raynaud’s phenomena and other extremity impairments due to peripheral vascular disorders resulting from diseases of the arteries, veins, or lymphatics is discussed in Chapter 4, The Cardiovascular System: Systemic and Pulmonary Arteries, Section 4.3.

Table 16-17 provides a similar classification of impairments due to peripheral vascular disease. Physical signs of vascular damage must be present and are the primary determinants in placing the examinee into one of these categories. Raynaud’s phenomenon consists of localized blanching of one or more fingers, followed by a period of cyanosis, followed by erythema. Pain on exposure to cold or generalized paleness of the fingers on exposure to cold does not in itself indicate Raynaud’s phenomenon. When amputation because of peripheral vascular disease is involved, the impairment resulting from amputation should be evaluated according to Section
16.2 and combined with the appropriate value in Table 16-17 by means of the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).

It is important to differentiate symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon on the basis of obstructive physiology from those occurring because of vasoreactivity. Individuals with obstructive physiology will often experience symptoms more frequently and with a greater degree of severity. Establish the presence of obstructive physiology by objective testing. Arterial pressure ratios between the affected digits and the brachial pressure (finger/brachial index) are easily performed. A ratio of < 0.8 suggests obstructive physiology, even if Raynaud’s symptoms are not present. Obstructive physiology can also be established by the use of cutaneous laser Doppler flowmetry. This technique is established and can reliably assess microcirculation performance and real-time changes in skin blood flow.

Impairment of 0% to 9% is indicated by documented Raynaud’s phenomenon with obstructive physiology (as documented by finger-brachial indices of less than 0.8 or low digital temperatures with decreased laser Doppler signals that do not normalize with warming of affected digits) that completely responds to lifestyle changes and/or medical therapy.

Impairment of 10% to 39% is indicated by symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon with obstructive physiology (as documented by finger-brachial indices of less than 0.8 or low digital temperatures with decreased laser Doppler signals that do not normalize with warming of affected digits) that incompletely responds to lifestyle changes and medical therapy.

The hand impairment value of each digit is the same throughout this entire chapter. If more than one
joint of a specific digit is affected by impairments due to “other disorders” listed in this section, the applicable joint impairment ratings are added only when the joints involved have a full range of motion. Otherwise, the joint impairment values are combined using the Combined Values Chart.
-- chars 3014 --
Skin disorders, including disfigurement, scars, and skin grafts, are evaluated using criteria in Chapter 8, The Skin.

Impairments from the disorders considered in this section under the category of “other disorders” are usually estimated by using other impairment evaluation criteria. The criteria described in this section should be used only when the other criteria have not adequately encompassed the extent of the impairments. Some of the conditions described in this section can be concurrent with each other and with decreased motion because they share overlapping pathomechanics. The evaluator must have good understanding of pathomechanics of deformities and apply proper judgment to avoid duplication of impairment ratings.

16.7a Bone and Joint Deformities
If the same unit presents several findings, the following rules must be followed to avoid duplication of impairments. In the digits, wrist, and elbow, manifestations of joint translocation can include lateral deviation, rotational deformity (digit), and/or subluxation or dislocation in any combination. The impairment values due to these findings cannot be combined, and only the finding with the highest impairment value is rated. Limited motion impairment is rated according to Section 16.4 and can be appropriately combined with impairments due to “other disorders” listed in this section, except with those due to joint swelling from synovial hypertrophy, persistent joint subluxation or dislocation, and musculotendinous disorders (Section 16.7c). Joint instability impairment values can be combined with other appropriate impairment values, including decreased motion, but not with arthroplasty. Joint swelling due to synovial hypertrophy is rated only when no other findings are present. Joint crepitation is not rated separately because other findings, such as those listed above, are more reliable indicators of the severity of the same arthritic process.

Modified from Swanson AB, Mays JD, Yamauchi Y. A rheumatoid arthritis evaluation record for the upper extremity. Surg Clin North Am. 1968;48:1003-1013.

Joint Swelling Due to Synovial Hypertrophy Synovial hypertrophy is a sign of an inflammatory arthritic process that can progress through varying the manifestations listed above, including decreased motion. If synovial hypertrophy is the only finding, the joint impairment is rated according to Table 1619 and multiplied by the relative maximum value of the joint involved (Table 16-18). It cannot be combined with impairment due to decreased joint motion or other findings.

Digit Lateral Deviation
The deviation from longitudinal alignment of each of the digital joints is measured in degrees during maximum active extension. Since lateral deviation at any level affects the longitudinal arch of the digit, the deviation impairment value is applied to the entire digit. If lateral deviation is the only impairment, the severity of digit impairment (Table 16-20) is multiplied by the relative hand value of the digit (Table
-- chars 3176 --
16-18) to determine the hand impairment. The lateral deviation impairment percent can be combined with other impairments of the same digits, including motion, according to the rules outlined on page 499 (Combined Values Chart, p. 604).

roentgenographic findings. The severity categories cannot be added or combined. The selected upper extremity impairment value may be combined only with limited wrist motion. Pain and decreased strength are not rated separately.

The scapholunate and radiolunate angles are measured on a lateral radiograph taken with the fist forcefully clenched (stressed view) and the wrist in neutral flexion/extension and lateral deviation. Lines are drawn on the film parallel to the long axis of the radius, through the long axis of the scaphoid (palmar surface), and a line representing the long axis of the lunate (a line perpendicular to the line connecting the two distal poles [Figure 16-51]). The angles between these lines are measured. The normal radiolunate relationship should be less than 10° of either volar or dorsal lunate angulation. The scapholunate angle ranges from 30° to 60° (average of 47°). The triquetrolunate stepoff is measured on the neutral posteroanterior (PA) view and represents proximal or ulnar translation of the triquetrum. The scapholunate gap is best profiled on a neutral PA view with the ulnar aspect of the hand elevated 10° to 15° or on a neutral anteroposterior (AP) view.

Ulnar translation may occur secondary to injury or arthritis. It is measured on the neutral PA view with the fist forcefully clenched. Normally, greater than 50% of the lunate overlies the ulnar border of the distal radius. As ulnar translation becomes more severe, progressively less of the lunate overlies the radius. The grades of severity of upper extremity impairment are classified as mild (8%), wherein less than 50% of the lunate overlies the distal radius ulnar

border; moderate (16%), wherein less than 25% of the lunate overlies the distal radius ulnar border; and severe (24%), wherein the lunate is displaced ulnarly off the radius (Table 16-25).

The loading posterior/anterior drawer test is performed with the individual supine and the shoulder in neutral rotation, 60° abduction, and 30° flexion. One hand stabilizes the extremity in neutral rotation, and the other applies a posteriorly directed force to subluxate the shoulder posteriorly. The position of the examiner’s hands is reversed to reproduce the maneuver applying an anteriorly directed force. Note that in a clinical setting, the examiner can usually evaluate the severity of instability without inducing a shoulder dislocation.

The posterior/anterior glenohumeral translation has been classified as follows:
-- chars 3048 --
Trace: Small movement of the humeral head.
Class I: Humeral head rides up the glenoid but not over the rim.
Class II: Humeral head subluxes over the glenoid rim but reduces spontaneously in position when the axial load is withdrawn.
Class III: Humeral head frankly dislocates over the glenoid rim and remains dislocated with removal of force.

The apprehension and relocation tests are best carried out with the individual in a supine position. The anterior apprehension test is performed by applying external rotation as the shoulder is held in 90° abduction. If the test is positive, the individual fears that the humeral head will slide out, causing pain.
Muscular defense against the motion is usually present. However, presence of pain alone is not necessarily diagnostic of instability. The anterior relocation test (Jobe’s) is performed by applying a posteriorly directed force to the proximal humerus while the shoulder is in 90° abduction and external rotation with the individual supine. This posterior stabilizing force should reduce the humeral head and relieve any apprehension of anterior instability.

Shoulder instability patterns are based on the parameters listed in Table 16-26 and can be classified as occult instability, instability with a subluxating humeral head, and instability with a dislocating humeral head. The shoulder representing 60% of the upper extremity (Table 16-18), the patterns of occult (10%), subluxating (20%), and dislocating (40%) instabilities represent upper extremity impairments of 6%, 12%, and 24%, respectively. This value may be combined only with impairments due to decreased motion (Section 16.4). Pain and decreased muscle strength are not rated separately.

Analysis: According to Table 16-26, a class II humeral translation (subluxating head) with a history of previous trauma, consistent relationship of symptoms with specific motions, reproducible symptoms on clinical testing, and positive radiographic findings corresponds to 12% upper extremity impairment.
The upper extremity impairment due to decreased shoulder motion is found in Section 16.4: IADD% = 0% and IABD% = 2% (Figure 16-43); IIR% = 0%
and IER% = 0% (Figure 16-46). The upper extremity motion impairment is 2%.
Impairment Rating: The upper extremity impairments due to shoulder instability (12%) and decreased motion (2%) are combined (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) and equal 14% of the upper extremity, or 8% of the whole person (Table 16-3).

Extensor Tendon Subluxation at the MP Joint of the Fingers
The digit impairment due to extensor tendon subluxation at the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint (Table 1630) is multiplied by the relative hand value of the digit (Table 16-18) to obtain its hand impairment value. It cannot be combined with impairment due to restricted motion at the MP joint or to other related manifestations of the same pathomechanical disturbance.

16.7 d Tendinitis
Several syndromes involving the upper extremity are variously attributed to tendinitis, fasciitis, or epicondylitis. The most common of these are the stubborn conditions of the origins of the flexor and extensor muscles of the forearm where they attach to the medial and lateral epicondyles of the humerus. Although these conditions may be persistent for some time, they are not given a permanent impairment rating unless there is some other factor that must be considered.

If an individual has had tendon rupture or has undergone surgical release of the flexor or extensor origins or medial or lateral epicondylitis, or has had excision of the epicondyle, there may be some permanent weakness of grip as a result of the tendon rupture or the surgery. In this case, impairment can be given on the basis of weakness of grip strength according to Section 16.8b. Although there is no good data on the time required to regain maximum strength after surgery, the data on strength loss after carpal tunnel release suggests that impairment rating according to Section 16.8b should not be determined less than 1 year after surgery.

16.8 Strength Evaluation
Because strength measurements are functional tests influenced by subjective factors that are difficult to control and the Guides for the most part is based on anatomic impairment, the Guides does not assign a large role to such measurements. Those who have contributed to the Guides believe that further research is needed before loss of grip and pinch strength is given a larger role in impairment evaluation.

Strength measures the power with which musculotendinous units act across a bone-joint lever-arm system to actively generate motion, or passively resist movement against gravity and variable resistance.
The effectiveness and magnitude of muscle contraction depends on the integrity of the dynamic and passive elements of a complex lever system, including its muscles and tendons, normal passive motion in the joints across which the muscles act, and the quality of innervation of the muscles. Many subjective or nonmeasurable factors, including fatigue, handedness, time of day, age, nutritional state, pain, and the individual’s cooperation, further influence strength measurements. Voluntary muscle strength testing remains somewhat subjective until a precise way of measuring muscle contraction is generally available. It should also be noted that the correlation of strength with performance of activities of daily living is poor and that increased strength does not necessarily equate with increased function.

16.8 a Principles
In a rare case, if the examiner believes the individual’s loss of strength represents an impairing factor that has not been considered adequately by other methods in the Guides, the loss of strength may be rated separately. An example of this situation would be loss of strength due to a severe muscle tear that healed leaving a palpable muscle defect. If the examiner judges that loss of strength should be rated separately in an extremity that presents other impairments, the impairment due to loss of strength could be combined with the other impairments, only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes. Otherwise, the impairment ratings based on objective anatomic findings take precedence.
Decreased strength cannot be rated in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of parts (eg, thumb amputation) that prevent effective application of maximal force in the region being evaluated.

Motor weakness associated with disorders of the peripheral nerve system and various degenerative neuromuscular conditions are evaluated according to guidelines described in Section 16.5 and the Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System. It should be understood that weakness or loss of strength can occur without muscle atrophy.

When evaluating strength, the examiner must have good reason to believe the individual has reached maximal medical improvement and that the condition is a “permanent” one as defined in Chapter 1 and the Glossary. Maximum strength is usually not regained for at least a year after an injury or surgical procedure. Because impairment is evaluated when the individual has reached MMI, strength can only be applied as a measure when a year or more has passed since the time of injury or surgery. This determination is best made with measurements taken over a period of time. Two methods are used to determine loss of strength in the upper extremity. Measurements of grip and pinch strength are used to evaluate power weaknesses relating to the structures in the hand, wrist, or forearm.
Manual muscle testing of major groups is used for testing strength about the elbow and shoulder.

16.8b Grip and Pinch Strength
Tests repeated at intervals during an examination are considered to be reliable if there is less than 20% variation in the readings. If there is more than 20% variation in the readings, one may assume the individual is not exerting full effort. The test is usually repeated three times with each hand at different times during the examination, and the values are recorded and later compared.

Grip strength measurements must be performed in a standard manner because altering wrist, forearm, and/or elbow position will change the results. The generally accepted position for measurements is for the individual to be seated with back against the chair and feet flat on the floor. The arm should be relaxed beside the lateral torso, the elbow flexed at 90°, and the forearm and wrist in neutral position. Grip strength measurements may be taken with a Jamar dynamometer. The second (4 cm) or third
-- chars 3131 --
(6 cm) position, according to the size of the hand, usually allows the individual to apply maximal force comfortably.

Two techniques have been reported to help detect individuals who exert less than maximal effort on grip strength testing. Stokes pointed out that the plotting of grip strength measurements from each of the five handle settings of the Jamar dynamometer would produce a bell-shaped curve. Those individuals not exerting maximal effort will produce results yielding a straight line or a flat curve.

An alternate method is the rapid exchange grip technique. The grip strength first is determined by standard techniques. The individual then is instructed to grip the dynamometer with maximal effort, first with one hand, then quickly with the other hand, for at least five exchanges. Individuals who did not exert maximal effort with the standard technique will record significantly higher strength readings. If they become aware of this, the strength of both hands will drop dramatically.

Pinch strength measurements are done with a pinch gauge and may include chuck or three-digit pinch, key or lateral pinch, and tip pinch with separate digits. Key pinch measurements usually are sufficient. Measurements are repeated three times. The three readings each for grip and pinch strength are averaged and compared to those of the opposite extremity, which usually is normal. If both extremities are involved, the strength measurements are compared to the average normal strengths listed in Tables 16-31 through 16-33.

If there is evidence that the individual is exerting less than maximal effort, the grip strength measurements are invalid for estimating impairment. It is acknowledged that wide variations exist in strength, even among persons doing the same kind of work. Little evidence exists of a significant difference in grip strength between the dominant and nondominant hand. If the evaluator believes that a significant difference in grip strength was lost in the dominant hand and that it impacts the ability to perform activities of daily living, this should be addressed in the evaluation report (see Section 16.1b).

An index of loss of strength uses the following formula:

Normal strength – Limited strength = Strength loss Normal strength
index %

Impairments of the upper extremity due to loss of pinch and grip strength are based on the values of the strength loss index shown in Table 16-34.

Rate the function that measures the greatest loss of strength. Both measurements are not applied.

16.8c Manual Muscle Testing
Manual muscle testing assesses an individual’s ability to move a joint through a full range of motion against gravity, or move it against additional resistance applied by the examiner, and/or hold the joint position against resistance. Manual muscle testing is subject to the individual’s conscious or unconscious control. Individuals whose performance is inhibited by pain or fear of pain may not be good candidates for this testing. Results of strength testing should be reproducible on different occasions or by two or more trained observers.

‡ Complete range of motion against gravity with some resistance.

Derived from Section 16.4 and Table 16-11 by G. de Groot Swanson, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Upper extremity impairment ratings for strength deficits about the elbow and shoulder (Table 16-35) were derived by multiplying the maximum relative value of each unit of motion by the percentage of severity of strength deficit found on manual muscle testing. The relative functional value of each unit of motion is the same as in Section 16.4, Evaluating Abnormal Motion. The severity of strength deficits is classified and rated on the same principles used for evaluation of the peripheral nerves (Table 16-11).
The numeric grades are sometimes also named 5, normal; 4, good; 3, fair; 2, poor; 1, trace; and 0, no muscle contraction. In the absence of peripheral nerve involvement, most weaknesses usually fall in the grade 4 category: “complete active range of motion against gravity with some resistance.” Few injuries result in a more profound weakness, such as a grade 3 category: “complete active range of motion against gravity only, without resistance.” Muscle strength graded 3 or lower is usually accompanied by other clinical findings such as atrophy. Because the functional units of motion of each joint were assigned on a 100% scale, the upper extremity impairment values derived for weakness of each unit of motion are added directly together.
