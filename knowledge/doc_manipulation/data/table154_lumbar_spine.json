    "DRE Thoracic Category II 5%-8% Impairment of the Whole Person": "History and examination findings are compatible with a specific injury or illness; findings may include significant muscle guarding or spasm observed at the time of the examination, asymmetric loss of range of motion (dysmetria), or nonverifiable radicular complaints, defined as complaints of radicular pain without objective findings; no alteration of motion segment integrity or herniated disk at the level and on the side that would be expected from objective clinical findings, but without radicular signs following conservative treatment or fractures: (1) less than 25% compression of one vertebral body; (2) posterior element fracture without dislocation that has healed without alteration of motion segment integrity or radiculopathy; (3) a spinous or transverse process fracture with displacement, but without a vertebral body fracture",
    "DRE Thoracic Category III 15%-18% Impairment of the Whole Person": "Ongoing neurologic impairment of the lower extremity related to a thoracolumbar injury, documented by examination of motor and sensory functions, reflexes, or findings of unilateral atrophy above or below the knee related to no other condition; impairment may be verified by electrodiagnostic testing or clinically significant radiculopathy, verified by an imaging study that demonstrates a herniated disk at the level and on the side that would be expected from objective clinical findings; history of radiculopathy, which has improved following surgical treatment or fractures: (1) 25% to 50% compression fracture of one vertebral body; (2) posterior element fracture with mild displacement disrupting the canal; in both cases the fracture has healed without alteration of structural integrity; differentiation from a congenital or developmental condition should be accomplished, if possible, by examining preinjury roentgenograms, if available, or by a bone scan performed after the onset of the condition",
    "DRE Thoracic Category IV 20%-23% Impairment of the Whole Person": "Alteration of motion segment integrity or bilateral or multilevel radiculopathy; alteration of motion segment integrity is defined from flexion and extension radiographs as translation of one vertebra on another of more than 2.5 mm; radiculopathy as defined in thoracic category III need not be present if there is alteration of motion segment integrity; if an individual is to be placed in DRE thoracic category IV due to radiculopathy, the latter must be bilateral or involve more than one level or fractures: (1) more than 50% compression of one vertebral body without residual neural compromise",
    "DRE Thoracic Category V 25%-28% Impairment of the Whole Person": "Impairment of the lower extremity as defined in thoracolumbar category III and loss of structural integrity as defined in thoracic category IV or fractures: (1) greater than 50% compression of one vertebral body with neural motor compromise but not bilateral involvement that would qualify the individual for corticospinal tract evaluation"
