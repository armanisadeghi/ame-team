Sections of the first edition of the Guides were originally published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, beginning in 1958 and continuing until August 1970.1 Since then, the Guides has undergone four revisions, culminating in the current, fifth edition. The purpose of this fifth edition of the Guides is to update the diagnostic criteria and evaluation process used in impairment assessment, incorporating available scientific evidence and prevailing medical opinion. Chapter authors were encouraged to use the latest scientific evidence from their specialty and, where evidence was lacking, develop a consensus view. This chapter was revised from the earlier edition in response to specific requests from user groups concerning the definitions, appropriate use, and scope of application of the Guides.\nThe fifth edition includes most of the common conditions, excluding unusual cases that require individual consideration. Since this edition encompasses the most current criteria and procedures for impairment assessment, it is strongly recommended that physicians use this latest edition, the fifth edition, when rating impairment.\n\n1.2 Impairment, Disability, and\nHandicap\n\n1.2a Impairment\nThe Guides continues to define impairment as\n\u201ca loss, loss of use, or derangement of any body part, organ system, or organ function.\u201d 2 This definition of impairment is retained in this edition. A medical impairment can develop from an illness or injury. An impairment is considered permanent when it has reached maximal medical improvement (MMI), meaning it is well stabilized and unlikely to change substantially in the next year with or without medical treatment. The term impairment in the Guides refers to permanent impairment, which is the focus of the Guides.\nAn impairment can be manifested objectively, for example, by a fracture, and/or subjectively, through fatigue and pain.3 Although the Guides emphasizes objective assessment, subjective symptoms are included within the diagnostic criteria. According to the Guides, determining whether an injury or illness results in a permanent impairment requires a medical assessment performed by a physician. An impairment may lead to functional limitations or the inability to perform activities of daily living.",
  "Section 2 - 3027 chars": "Table 1-1, adapted from a report by the AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, lists various definitions of impairment and disability used by four main authorities: the AMA Guides, the World Health Organization, the Social Security Administration, and a state workers\u2019 compensation statute.4 Although a nationally accepted definition for impairment does not exist, the general concept of impairment is similar in the definitions of most organizations. Several terms used in the AMA definition, and their application throughout the Guides, will be discussed in this chapter and Chapter 2.\nLoss, loss of use, or derangement implies a change from a normal or \u201cpreexisting\u201d state. Normal is a range or zone representing healthy functioning and varies with age, gender, and other factors such as environmental conditions. For example, normal heart rate varies between a child and adult and according to whether the person is at rest or exercising.\nMultiple factors need to be considered when assessing whether a specific or overall function is normal. A normal value can be defined from an individual or population perspective.\nWhen evaluating an individual, a physician has two options: consider the individual\u2019s healthy preinjury or preillness state or the condition of the unaffected side as \u201cnormal\u201d for the individual if this is known, or compare that individual to a normal value defined by population averages of healthy people. The Guides uses both approaches. Accepted population values for conditions such as extremity range-ofmotion or lung function are listed in the Guides; it is recommended that the physician use those values as detailed in the Guides when applicable. In other circumstances, for instance, where population values are not available, the physician should use clinical judgment regarding normal structure and function and estimate what is normal for the individual based on the physician\u2019s knowledge or estimate of the individual\u2019s preinjury or preillness condition.\nData from healthy populations, when available and widely referenced, are incorporated into chapters of the Guides. In some organ or body systems, such as respiratory, certain measurements of lung function have been standardized for age and gender. In other body systems, such as the musculoskeletal, age and gender differences are not reflected in most of the values. While there may be age and gender differences anticipated for some musculoskeletal values, such as range of motion in the spine and extremities, this edition of the Guides mainly reflects average range of motion from healthy populations of mixed age and gender. The normal values presented in the musculoskeletal section are based on a review of studies measuring range of motion, as cited in the text. Evaluating physicians may use their clinical judgment, however, and comment on any significant age or gender effect for a particular individual. For instance, the \u201cnormal\u201d preinjury range of motion for a gymnast with hypermobility may exceed the listed normal values.",
  "Section 3 - 3681 chars": "If an individual had previous measurements of function that were below or above average population values, the physician may discuss that prior value and any subsequent loss for the individual, as well as compare it to the population normal. For example, a highly functioning athlete with documented, abovenormal lung function, who has sustained an injury and now has decreased lung function that is nonetheless similar to population averages, has experienced a loss in his or her lung function and has sustained an impairment. Based only on a population comparison, the athlete would be given a 0% impairment rating. However, it would be more appropriate in this instance for the physician to assign an impairment rating based on the degree of change from the athlete\u2019s preinjury to postinjury state.\nIn evaluating impairment, the Guides considers both anatomic and functional loss. Some chapters place a greater emphasis on either anatomic or functional loss, depending upon common practice in that specialty. Anatomic loss refers to damage to the organ system or body structure, while functional loss refers to a change in function for the organ or body system. An example of an anatomic deviation is development of heart enlargement; functional loss includes a loss in ejection fraction or the ability of the heart to pump adequately. Anatomic loss receives greater emphasis in the musculoskeletal system, as in measurements such as range of motion. Functional considerations receive greater emphasis in the mental and behavioral section.\nThe impairment criteria outlined in the Guides provide a standardized method for physicians to use to determine medical impairment. The impairment criteria include diagnostic criteria, incorporating anatomic and functional measures. The impairment criteria were developed from scientific evidence as cited and from consensus of chapter authors or of medical specialty societies.\nImpairment percentages or ratings developed by medical specialists are consensus-derived estimates that reflect the severity of the medical condition and the degree to which the impairment decreases an individual\u2019s ability to perform common activities of daily living (ADL), excluding work. Impairment ratings were designed to reflect functional limitations and not disability. The whole person impairment percentages listed in the Guides estimate the impact of the impairment on the individual\u2019s overall ability to perform activities of daily living, excluding work, as listed in Table 1-2.\nThe medical judgment used to determine the original impairment percentages could not account for the diversity or complexity of work but could account for daily activities common to most people. Work is not included in the clinical judgment for impairment percentages for several reasons: (1) work involves many simple and complex activities; (2) work is highly individualized, making generalizations inaccurate; (3) impairment percentages are unchanged for stable conditions, but work and occupations change; and (4) impairments interact with such other factors as the worker\u2019s age, education, and prior work experience to determine the extent of work disability. For example, an individual who receives a 30% whole person impairment due to pericardial heart disease is considered from a clinical standpoint to have a 30% reduction in general functioning as represented by a decrease in the ability to perform activities of daily living. For individuals who work in sedentary jobs, there may be no decline in their work ability although their overall functioning is decreased. Thus, a 30% impairment rating does not correspond to a 30% reduction in work capability.",
  "Section 4 - 3682 chars": "Similarly, a manual laborer with this 30% impairment rating due to pericardial disease may be completely unable to do his or her regular job and, thus, may have a 100% work disability.\nAs a result, impairment ratings are not intended for use as direct determinants of work disability. When a physician is asked to evaluate work-related disability, it is appropriate for a physician knowledgeable about the work activities of the patient to discuss the specific activities the worker can and cannot do, given the permanent impairment.\nMost impairment percentages in this fifth edition have been retained from the fourth edition because there are limited scientific data to support specific changes. It is recognized that there are limited data to support some of the previous impairment percentages as well. However, these ratings are currently accepted and should not be changed arbitrarily. In this edition, some percentages have been changed for greater scientific accuracy or to achieve consistency throughout the book.\nA 0% whole person (WP) impairment rating is assigned to an individual with an impairment if the impairment has no significant organ or body system functional consequences and does not limit the performance of the common activities of daily living\nindicated in Table 1-2. A 90% to 100% WP impairment indicates a very severe organ or body system impairment requiring the individual to be fully dependent on others for self-care, approaching death.\nThe activities of daily living, as originally developed for the Guides in the first and second editions,1,6 signify common activities currently represented in scales of Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living.7 The Guides refers to common ADLs, as listed in Table 1-2. The ADLs listed in this table correspond to the activities that physicians should consider when establishing a permanent impairment rating. A physician can often assess a person\u2019s ability to perform ADLs based on knowledge of the patient\u2019s medical condition and clinical judgment. When the physician is estimating a permanent impairment rating, Table 1-2 can help to determine how significantly the impairment impacts these activities. Using the impairment criteria within a class and knowing the activities the individual can perform, the physician can estimate where the individual stands within that class.\nThere are many scales that measure ability to perform ADLs with greater degrees of accuracy. Many of these scales are concerned with more severe levels of disability, relevant to institutionalized patients and the elderly.7 During the 1970s, the ADL concept was extended to consider problems experienced by those living in the community, a field that has come to be termed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL).7 There is a continued effort to validate these scales; some of the more commonly utilized, validated IADL and ADL scales are listed in Table 1-3.7 Scales vary in their appropriateness for a given individual, based upon the level of impairment, body systems affected, and degree of accuracy required. Some scales are most appropriate for an active, working population; others are more suited to a chronically ill, disabled population. Since there is no agreed-upon scale for a working population and physicians who use the Guides may evaluate different populations of individuals (ie, healthy or chronically ill), a physician may choose the most appropriate of any of the validated scales for a more in-depth assessment of ADL, to obtain further information to supplement clinical judgment, or to gain assistance in determining where an individual stands within an impairment range.",
  "Section 5 - 3190 chars": "ADL\nPhilosophy, Purpose, and Appropriate Use of the Guides\n\n1.2b Disability\nThe term disability has historically referred to a broad category of individuals with diverse limitations in the ability to meet social or occupational demands. However, it is more accurate to refer to the specific activity or role the \u201cdisabled\u201d individual is unable to perform. Several organizations are moving away from the term disability and instead are referring to specific activity limitations to encourage an emphasis on the specific activities the individual can perform and to identify how the environment can be altered\nto enable the individual to perform the activities associated with various social or occupational roles. (Table 1-1).4\nAccording to a 1997 Institute of Medicine Report, \u201cdisability is a relational outcome, reflecting the individual\u2019s capacity to perform a specific task or activity, contingent on the environmental conditions in which they are to be performed.\u201d16 Disability is context-specific, not inherent in the individual, but a function of the interaction of the individual and the environment.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is revising its 1980 International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps and has released a draft document, The International Classification of Impairments, Activities and Participation (ICIDH-2).17 The term disability has been replaced by a neutral term, activity, and limits in ability are described as activity limitations. The change in terminology arose for several reasons: to choose terminology without an associated stigma, to avoid labeling, and to emphasize the person\u2019s residual ability. Representatives worldwide are reviewing this international classification scale of impairments, function, and activities.\nThe Guides continues to define disability as an alteration of an individual\u2019s capacity to meet personal, social, or occupational demands or statutory or regulatory requirements because of an impairment.2 An individual can have a disability in performing a specific work activity but not have a disability in any other social role.2 Physicians have the education and training to evaluate a person\u2019s health status and determine the presence or absence of an impairment. If the physician has the expertise and is well acquainted with the individual\u2019s activities and needs, the physician may also express an opinion about the presence or absence of a specific disability. For example, an occupational medicine physician who understands the job requirements in a particular workplace can provide insights on how the impairment could contribute to a workplace disability.\nThe impairment evaluation, however, is only one aspect of disability determination. A disability determination also includes information about the individual\u2019s skills, education, job history, adaptability, age, and environment requirements and modifications.3 Assessing these factors can provide a more realistic picture of the effects of the impairment on the ability to perform complex work and social activities. If adaptations can be made to the environment, the individual may not be disabled from performing that activity.",
  "Section 6 - 3110 chars": "Philosophy, Purpose, and Appropriate Use of the Guides\n\n9\nAs discussed in this chapter and illustrated in Figure 1-1, medical impairments are not related to disability in a linear fashion. An individual with a medical impairment can have no disability for some occupations, yet be very disabled for others. For example, severe degenerative disk disease may impair the functioning of the spine of both a licensed practical nurse and a bank president in a similar fashion when performing their activities of daily living. However, in terms of occupation, the bank president is less likely to be disabled by this impairment than the licensed practical nurse. An individual who develops rheumatoid arthritis may be disabled from work as a tailor but may be able to work as a child care aide. A pilot who develops a visual impairment, correctable with glasses, may be able to perform all of his daily activities but is no longer able to fly a commercial plane. An individual with repeated hernias and repairs may no longer be able to lift more than\n\n20 kg (40 lb) but could work in a factory where mechanical lifts are available.\nThe Guides is not intended to be used for direct estimates of work disability. Impairment percentages derived according to the Guides criteria do not measure work disability. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use the Guides\u2019 criteria or ratings to make direct estimates of work disability.\n\n1.2c Handicap\nHandicap is a term historically used in both a legal and a policy context to describe disability or people living with disabilities. Though the term continues to be used, generally it is being replaced with the preferred term disability.\n\n1.3 The Organ System and Whole Body Approach to\nImpairment\nThe Guides impairment ratings reflect the severity and limitations of the organ/body system impairment and resulting functional limitations. Most organ/body systems chapters in the Guides provide impairment ratings that represent the extent of whole person impairment. In addition to listing whole person impairments, the musculoskeletal chapters provide regional impairment ratings (eg, upper extremity, lower extremity); regional ratings are then converted into whole person impairment ratings. Within some musculoskeletal regions, a consensus group developed weights to reflect the relative importance of certain regions. For example, different fingers or different areas of the spine are given different weights, representing their unique and relative importance to the region\u2019s overall functioning. These weights, which have gained acceptance in clinical practice, have been retained to enable regulatory authorities to convert from a regional body to whole person impairment when needed.\n\n1.4 Philosophy and Use of the Combined\nValues Chart\nThe Combined Values Chart (p. 604) was designed to enable the physician to account for the effects of multiple impairments with a summary value. A standard formula was used to ensure that regardless of the number of impairments, the summary value would not exceed 100% of the whole person.",
  "Section 7 - 3146 chars": "According to the formula listed in the combined values chart, multiple impairments are combined so that the whole person impairment value is equal to or less than the sum of all the individual impairment values.\nA scientific formula has not been established to indicate the best way to combine multiple impairments. Given the diversity of impairments and great variability inherent in combining multiple impairments, it is difficult to establish a formula that accounts for all situations. A combination of some impairments could decrease overall functioning more than suggested by just adding the impairment ratings for the separate impairments (eg, blindness and inability to use both hands). When other multiple impairments are combined, a less than additive approach may be more appropriate. States also use different techniques when combining impairments. Many workers\u2019 compensation statutes contain provisions that combine impairments to produce a summary rating that is more than additive. Other options are to combine (add, subtract, or multiply) multiple impairments based upon the extent to which they affect an individual\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living. The current edition has retained the same combined values chart, since it has become the standard of practice in many jurisdictions. Other approaches, when published in scientific peer-reviewed literature, will be evaluated for future editions.\nIn general, impairment ratings within the same region are combined before combining the regional impairment rating with that from another region. For example, when there are multiple impairments involving abnormal motion, neurologic loss, and amputation of an extremity part, these impairments first should be combined for a regional extremity impairment. The regional extremity impairment then is combined with an impairment from another region, such as from the respiratory system. Spinal impairments in multiple regions are combined.\nExceptions, as detailed in the musculoskeletal chapter, include impairments of the joints of the thumb, which are added, as are the ankle and subtalar joints in the lower extremity: both situations include complex motions.\n\n1.5\nIncorporating Science with Clinical\nJudgment\nThe Guides uses objective and scientifically based data when available and references these sources. When objective data have not been identified, estimates of the degree of impairment are used, based on clinical experience and consensus. Subjective concerns, including fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, and pain, when not accompanied by demonstrable clinical signs or other independent, measurable abnormalities, are generally not given separate impairment ratings. Chronic pain is discussed in Chapter 18. Physicians recognize the local and distant pain that commonly accompanies many disorders. Impairment ratings in the Guides already have accounted for commonly associated pain, including that which may be experienced in areas distant to the specific site of pathology. For example, when a cervical spine disorder produces radiating pain down the arm, the arm pain, which is commonly seen,",
  "Section 8 - 3044 chars": "has been accounted for in the cervical spine impairment rating.\nThe Guides does not deny the existence or importance of these subjective complaints to the individual or their functional impact. The Guides recommends that the physician ascertain and document subjective concerns. Because the presence and severity of subjective concerns varies among individuals with the same condition, the Guides has not yet identified an accepted method within the scientific literature to ascertain how these concerns consistently affect organ or body system functioning. The physician is encouraged to discuss these concerns and symptoms in the impairment evaluation.\nResearch is limited on the reproducibility and validity of the Guides.18-20 Anecdotal reports indicate that adoption of the Guides results in a more standardized impairment assessment process. As relevant research becomes available, subsequent editions of the Guides will incorporate these evidence-based studies to improve the Guides\u2019 reliability and validity.\nPhilosophy, Purpose, and Appropriate Use of the Guides\n\n11\nGiven the range, evolution, and discovery of new medical conditions, the Guides cannot provide an impairment rating for all impairments. Also, since some medical syndromes are poorly understood and are manifested only by subjective symptoms, impairment ratings are not provided for those conditions.\nThe Guides nonetheless provides a framework for evaluating new or complex conditions. Most adult conditions with measurable impairments can be evaluated under the Guides. In situations where impairment ratings are not provided, the Guides suggests that physicians use clinical judgment, comparing measurable impairment resulting from the unlisted condition to measurable impairment resulting from similar conditions with similar impairment of function in performing activities of daily living.\nThe physician\u2019s judgment, based upon experience, training, skill, thoroughness in clinical evaluation, and ability to apply the Guides criteria as intended, will enable an appropriate and reproducible assessment to be made of clinical impairment. Clinical judgment, combining both the \u201cart\u201d and \u201cscience\u201d of medicine, constitutes the essence of medical practice.\n\n1.6 Causation, Apportionment Analysis, and Aggravation\n\n1.6a Causation\nPhysicians may be asked to provide an opinion about the likelihood that a particular factor (injury, illness, or preexisiting condition) caused the permanent impairment. Determining causation is important from a legal perspective, as it is a factor in determining liability.\nThe term causation has multiple meanings. Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary lists 12 different types of \u201ccause\u201d including constitutional, exciting, immediate, local, precipitating, predisposing, primary, proximate, remote, secondary, specific, and ultimate.21 For purposes of the Guides, causation means an identifiable factor (eg, accident or exposure to hazards of a disease) that results in a medically identifiable condition.",
  "Section 9 - 3013 chars": "Medical or scientifically based causation requires a detailed analysis of whether the factor could have caused the condition, based upon scientific evidence and, specifically, experienced judgment as to whether the alleged factor in the existing environment did cause the permanent impairment.22 Determining medical causation requires a synthesis of medical judgment with scientific analysis.\nThe legal standard for causation in civil litigation and in workers\u2019 compensation adjudication varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.23 The physician needs to be aware of the different interpretations of causation and state the context in which the physician\u2019s opinion is being offered.\n\n1.6 b Apportionment Analysis Apportionment analysis in workers\u2019 compensation represents a distribution or allocation of causation among multiple factors that caused or significantly contributed to the injury or disease and resulting impairment. The factor could be a preexisting injury, illness, or impairment. In some instances, the physician may be asked to apportion or distribute a permanent impairment rating between the impact of the current injury and the prior impairment rating. Before determining apportionment, the physician needs to verify that all the following information is true for an individual:\n\n1. There is documentation of a prior factor.\n\n2. The current permanent impairment is greater as a result of the prior factor (ie, prior impairment, prior injury, or illness).\n\n3. There is evidence indicating the prior factor caused or contributed to the impairment, based on a reasonable probability (> 50% likelihood).\nThe apportionment analysis must consider the nature of the impairment and its possible relationship to each alleged factor, and it must provide an explanation of the medical basis for all conclusions and opinions. Most states have their own customized methods for calculating apportionment. Generally, the most recent permanent impairment rating is calculated, and then the prior impairment rating is calculated and deducted. The remaining impairment rating would be attributed or apportioned to the current injury or condition.\nA common verbal formulation in the workers\u2019 compensation context might state, \u201cin cases of permanent disability less than total, if the degree of disability resulting from an industrial injury or occupational disease is increased or prolonged because of a preexisting physical impairment, the employer shall be liable only for the additional disability from the injury or occupational disease.\u201d 5\nFor example, in apportioning a spine impairment rating in an individual with a history of a spine condition, one should calculate the current spine impairment. Then calculate the impairment from any preexisting spine problem. The preexisting impairment rating is then subtracted from the present impairment rating to account for the effects of the former. This approach requires accurate and comparable data for both impairments.23",
  "Section 10 - 3008 chars": "1.6c Aggravation\nAggravation, for the purposes of the Guides, refers to a factor(s) (eg, physical, chemical, biological, or medical condition) that alters the course or progression of the medical impairment. For example, an individual develops low back pain and sciatica associated with the finding of an L3-L4 herniated disk. Symptoms continue but are intermittent and do not interfere with performing activities of daily living. A few years later, the individual twists his body while lifting a heavy package and develops constant, severe, acute low back pain and sciatica. Imaging studies show no change in the herniated disk compared to earlier studies. The lifting is considered to have aggravated a preexisting condition.\nTerms such as causation, apportionment, and aggravation may all have unique legal definitions in the context of the system in which they are used. The physician is advised to compare these definitions with terminology accepted by the appropriate state or system.\n\n1.7\nUse of the Guides\nBecause of the scope, depth, standardized approach, and foundation in science and medical consensus, the Guides is used worldwide to estimate adult permanent impairment. A survey completed in 1999 indicates that in the United States, 40 of 51 jurisdictions (50 states and the District of Columbia) use the Guides in workers\u2019 compensation cases because of statute or regulations, or by administrative/legal practice.24\nThe Guides is formally accepted through adoptive language in each jurisdiction\u2019s statutes (laws passed by a state legislature or the US Congress), courtmade law (case law or precedent), or administrative agency regulation (rules promulgated by administrative agencies such as a state workers\u2019 compensation board). It is this statutory, judicial, or regulatory adoptive language that determines which edition of the Guides is mandated in a particular jurisdiction. Some states, such as Oregon and Florida, have developed their own impairment criteria, modeled on the concepts and material in the Guides. The Guides is also extensively used by the federal systems, eg, FECA (Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act). The most recent edition of the Guides is recommended as the latest blend of science and medical consensus.\nBeyond the United States, the Guides is used in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and European countries for different applications, including workers\u2019 compensation, personal injury, and disability claim management. There is a growing international trend to adopt a standardized, medically accepted approach to impairment assessment such as in the Guides. As previously stated, the Guides is not to be used for direct financial awards nor as the sole measure of disability. The Guides provides a standard medical assessment for impairment determination and may be used as a component in disability assessment.\nPhilosophy, Purpose, and Appropriate Use of the Guides\n\n13\n\n1.8 Impairment Evaluations in Workers\u2019",
  "Section 11 - 3191 chars": "Compensation\nIn the United States, workers\u2019 compensation is a\nno-fault system for providing cash benefits, medical care, and rehabilitation services to individuals with work-related injuries and diseases. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have workers\u2019 compensation acts. Most acts share similar features, although no two are exactly alike. An employee normally must experience a \u201cpersonal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment\u201d to be eligible for benefits. All states provide benefits for workers with occupational diseases, but that coverage is restricted in many states. The claimant receives payments to compensate for lost wages due to temporary total, temporary partial, permanent total, and permanent partial disability. Survivors receive death benefits. For each category of benefits, the state prescribes a maximum and minimum weekly benefit. Many states stipulate partial compensation for a partial loss, based upon a proportion of the number of weeks\u2019 compensation allowed for total loss of the body part.25 Determining eligibility of benefits and the extent of disability is specified by statute and case law.\nBecause schedules usually do not cover all conditions arising from injuries, many laws allow or require that, in unlisted cases of permanent disability, the jurisdiction must determine the percentage by which the \u201cwhole man\u201d or \u201cindustrial use\u201d of the employee\u2019s body was impaired. The board, commission, or court also must consider the nature of the injury and the employee\u2019s occupation, experience, training, and age and then award proportional compensation. Medical information is essential for the decision process in these cases.\nPhysicians who perform impairment and/or disability assessments for workers\u2019 compensation purposes need to identify the state workers\u2019 compensation law that applies to the situation, which is usually the state where the incident occurred. The physician needs to determine which edition of the Guides or other state guidelines are required for these assessments. This information can usually be obtained from the state workers\u2019 compensation board or the state medical society. If the Guides is recommended or required, copies may be ordered through the AMA (see copyright page) or other vendors.\nUnfortunately, there is no validated formula that assigns accurate weights to determine how a medical condition can be combined with other factors, including education, skill, and the like, to calculate the effect of the medical impairment on future employment. Therefore, each commissioner or hearing official bases a decision on the assessment of the available medical and nonmedical information. The Guides may help resolve such a situation, but it cannot provide complete and definitive answers. Each administrative or legal system that bases disability ratings on permanent impairment defines its own process of converting impairment ratings into a disability rating that reflects the degree to which the impairment limits the capacity to meet personal, social, occupational, and other demands, or to meet statutory requirements. The Guides is a tool for evaluation of permanent impairment.26, 27",
  "Section 12 - 3054 chars": "Impairment percentages derived from the Guides criteria should not be used as direct estimates of disability. Impairment percentages estimate the extent of the impairment on whole person functioning and account for basic activities of daily living, not including work. The complexity of work activities requires individual analyses.\nImpairment assessment is a necessary first step\nfor determining disability.\n\n1.9 Employability\nDeterminations\nPhysicians with the appropriate skills, training, and knowledge may address some of the implications of the medical impairment toward work disability and future employment. The physician may be asked whether an impaired individual can return to work in a particular job. The employer can provide a detailed job analysis, with the actual and anticipated essential requirements of the job and a review of the work environment, including potential hazards and the need for personal protective equipment. The physician can then determine whether the individual\u2019s abilities match the job demands. The physician needs to determine that the individual, in performing essential job functions, will not either be endangered or endanger colleagues or the work environment. For example, it would be unsafe for an individual with a new, unstable seizure disorder to operate mechanical equipment. The physician and other responsible persons should keep in mind the potential for impairment aggravation, as well as the possibility of\nchanging an individual\u2019s job responsibilities. After reviewing all the necessary information, the physician may then make an objective and repro-\nducible assessment of the ability of the individual to safely perform the essential functions of the job.\nMore complicated are the cases in which the physician is requested to make a broad judgment regarding an individual\u2019s ability to return to any job in his or her field. A decision of this scope usually requires input from medical and nonmedical experts, such as vocational specialists, and the evaluation of both stable and changing factors, such as the person\u2019s education, skills, and motivation, the state of the job market, and local economic considerations.\nPhysicians who follow the procedures outlined in the Guides, who review the same information from medical and employment records, and who examine the same patient with a stable condition should obtain approximately the same findings.\n\n1.10 Railroad and\nMaritime Workers\nState workers\u2019 compensation laws are not the only means by which employees are compensated for injuries or illnesses. In 1908, Congress passed the Federal Employer\u2019 s Liability Act (FELA), which put in place a comprehensive injury compensation system for railroad workers. FELA provides a modified tort system for injured railroad workers, and it supersedes state workers\u2019 compensation laws. The Jones Act, passed in 1920, covers compensation for maritime workers injured due to a ship owner\u2019s negligence. That law provides for the same rights and remedies that were extended through FELA.",
  "Section 13 - 3475 chars": "A lawsuit filed under FELA must be based on the railroad\u2019s negligence in providing the employee with a safe workplace. An injured employee must prove that the railroad should have foreseen that a condition or activity might cause the injury or disease. The test determines whether the employer\u2019s negligence played any part in producing the injury. Recoverable amounts include those for necessary medical expenses, pain and suffering, loss of past earnings, and future losses due to diminished earning capacity. An important condition for recovery is that a physician must diagnose the effects of the injury.\nUnder FELA, all cases must go before a jury or judge, and there are no limits to the amount awarded. In contrast, the awards under state workers\u2019 compensation systems are fixed and limited. Under FELA, the jury decides on the degree of the injured person\u2019s disability. The physician is obligated to obtain a reliable history, confirm past employment by obtaining records, and collect all available medical information.\n\n1.11 The Physician\u2019s Role Based on the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(ADA)\nPhysicians, particularly occupational physicians, are frequently asked questions pertaining to work disability and capacity, in light of increasing attention to compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA is a civil rights law that President Bush signed in 1990.28 It was intended \u201cto provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate to end discrimination against individuals with disabilities and bring those individuals into the economic and social mainstream of American life.\u201d18 Under the ADA, individuals with disabilities are protected against discrimination in such diverse areas as employment, government service entitlement, and access to public accommodations (eg, health care services, lodging).\nThe ADA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual; a record of impairment; or being regarded as having an impairment (see Table 1-1). A person needs to meet only one of the three criteria in the definition to gain the ADA\u2019s protection against discrimination. The physician\u2019s input often is essential for determining the first two criteria and valuable for determining the third.\nPhilosophy, Purpose, and Appropriate Use of the Guides\n\n15\nTo be deemed \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of ADA protection, an individual generally must have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. A \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d could be any mental, psychological, or physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss that affects one or more of the following body systems: neurologic, special sense organs, musculoskeletal, respiratory (including speech organs), reproductive, cardiovascular, hematologic and lymphatic, digestive, genitourinary, skin, and endocrine.29\nConditions that are temporary or not considered to be severe (eg, normal pregnancy) are not considered impairments under the ADA. Other nonimpairments include features and conditions such as hair or eye color, left-handedness, old age, sexual orientation, exhibitionism, pedophilia, voyeurism, sexual addiction, kleptomania, pyromania, compulsive gambling, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairment, smoking, and current illegal drug use or resulting psychoactive disorders.",
  "Section 14 - 3328 chars": "On June 23, 1999, in answer to a case seeking refinement of the definition of \u201cwho is disabled\u201d under the ADA, the Supreme Court stated that individuals who function normally with aids such as glasses or medication could not generally be considered disabled, despite their physical impairments.30\nTo have the protection of the ADA, a physical or mental impairment must substantially limit the ability to perform a \u201cmajor life activity.\u201d Major life activities include \u201cbasic activities that the average person in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty,\u201d including caring for oneself, manual tasks, hearing, walking, learning, speaking, breathing, working, and reproduction. Major life activities do not have to occur frequently or be part of daily life.31 Note that the major life activities listed here include work, unlike the Guides\u2019 impairment criteria.\nThe person must be presently, or perceived to be (not potentially or hypothetically), substantially limited in order to demonstrate a disability. It is difficult to determine if an impairment \u201csubstantially limits\u201d a major life activity. An impairment\u2019s nature, extent, duration, impact, and effect on the individual are all considerations in assessing the \u201csubstantiality\u201d of the limitations.32\nFor some major life activities, such as work, the physician may provide an opinion on the medical impairment\u2019s limitations. However, as indicated by the recent Supreme Court ruling, how much a limitation of a major life activity results in a determination of disability depends on the interaction between the remaining functional abilities and the possible types of accommodation being sought.33\nThe third criterion that may establish protection under the ADA is an erroneous perception that the individual is substantially limited in a major life activity or is being discriminated against on the basis of a real or perceived characteristic that does not substantially limit a major life activity.\nIt is the physician\u2019s responsibility to determine if the impairment results in functional limitations. The physician is responsible for informing the employer about an individual\u2019s abilities and limitations. It is the employer\u2019s responsibility to identify and determine if reasonable accommodations are possible to enable the individual\u2019s performance of essential job activities.\n\n1.12  Summary\nThe purpose of this chapter is to discuss the philosophical assumptions and appropriate use of the Guides. The physician needs to comply with prescribed local, state, and federal practices for impairment evaluations. Generally, the physician evaluates all available information and provides as comprehensive a medical picture of the patient as possible, addressing the components listed in the Report of Medical Evaluation form discussed in Chapter 2.\nA complete impairment evaluation provides valuable information beyond an impairment percentage, and it includes a discussion about the person\u2019s abilities and limitations, including the ability to perform common activities as listed in Table 1-2. Combining the medical and nonmedical information, and including detailed information about essential work activities if requested, is a basis for improved understanding of the degree to which the impairment may affect the individual\u2019s work ability.",

Two physicians, following the methods of the Guides to evaluate the same patient, should report similar results and reach similar conclusions. Moreover, if the clinical findings are fully described, any knowledgeable observer may check the findings with the Guides criteria. This chapter provides information about the practical application of the Guides and is to be used in conjunction with Chapter 1, which provides the conceptual framework upon which the instructions in this chapter are based.\n\n2.1 Defining\nImpairment Evaluations\nAn impairment evaluation is a medical evaluation performed by a physician, using a standard method as outlined in the Guides to determine permanent impairment associated with a medical condition. An impairment evaluation may include a numerical impairment percentage or rating, as defined in the Guides. An impairment evaluation is not the same as an independent medical evaluation (IME), which is performed by an independent medical examiner who evaluates but does not provide care for the individual. Impairment evaluations may be less comprehensive than IMEs and may be performed by a treating physician or a nontreating physician, depending upon the state\u2019s requirements and the preferences of the individual, physician, and requesting party. Examples of an impairment evaluation and components of a comprehensive IME will be discussed later in this chapter.\n\n\n2.2 Who Performs Impairment Evaluations?\nImpairment evaluations are performed by a licensed physician. The physician may use information from other sources, such as hearing results obtained from audiometry by a certified technician. However, the physician is responsible for performing a medical evaluation that addresses medical impairment in the body or organ system and related systems. A state may restrict the type of practitioner allowed to perform an impairment evaluation, and some require additional state certification and other criteria, such as a minimum number of hours of practice, before the physician is approved as an impairment evaluator. The physician is encouraged to check with the local workers\u2019 compensation agency, industrial accident board, or industrial commission concerning their prerequisites.\n\n2.3\nExaminers\u2019 Roles and Responsibilities\nThe physician\u2019s role in performing an impairment evaluation is to provide an independent, unbiased assessment of the individual\u2019s medical condition, including its effect on function, and identify abilities and limitations to performing activities of daily living as listed in Table 1-2. Performing an impairment evaluation requires considerable medical expertise and judgment. Full and complete reporting provides the best opportunity for physicians to explain health status and consequences to patients, other medical professionals, and other interested parties such as claims examiners and attorneys. Thorough documentation of medical findings and their impact will also ensure that reporting is fair and consistent and that individuals have the information needed to pursue any benefits to which they are entitled.",
  "Section 16 - 3017 chars": "The skills required for impairment evaluation are usually not taught during basic medical training, although some specialties such as occupational medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and orthopedics have emphasized elements of the evaluation such as occupational, functional, or anatomical assessment.\n\nIn some cases, physicians may be asked to assess the medical impairment\u2019s impact on the individual\u2019s ability to work. In the latter case, physicians need to understand the essential functions of the occupation and specific job, as well as how the medical condition interacts with the occupational demands. In many cases, the physician may need to obtain additional expertise to define functional abilities and limitations, as well as vocational demands.\n\nAs an impairment evaluator, the physician has the responsibility to understand the regulations that pertain to medical practice in his or her specific area, as in workers\u2019 compensation or personal injury evaluations. It is also the responsibility of the physician to provide the necessary medical assessment to the party requesting the evaluation, with the examinee\u2019s consent. The physician needs to ensure that the examinee understands that the evaluation\u2019s purpose is medical assessment, not medical treatment.\nHowever, if new diagnoses are discovered, the physician has a medical obligation to inform the requesting party and individual about the condition and recommend further medical assessment.\n\n\n2.4 When Are Impairment Ratings Performed?\nAn impairment should not be considered permanent until the clinical findings indicate that the medical condition is static and well stabilized, often termed the date of maximal medical improvement (MMI). It is understood that an individual\u2019s condition is dynamic. Maximal medical improvement refers to a date from which further recovery or deterioration is not anticipated, although over time there may be some expected change. Once an impairment has reached MMI, a permanent impairment rating may be performed. The Guides attempts to take into account all relevant considerations in rating the severity and extent of permanent impairment and its effect on the individual\u2019s activities of daily living.\n\nImpairments often involve more than one body system or organ system; the same condition may be discussed in more than one chapter. Generally, the organ system where the problems originate or where the dysfunction is greatest is the chapter to be used for evaluating the impairment. Thus, consult the vision chapter for visual problems due to optic nerve dysfunction. Refer to the extremity chapters for neurological and musculoskeletal extremity impairment from an injury. However, if the impairment is due to a stroke, the neurology chapter is most appropriate.\nWhenever the same impairment is discussed in different chapters, the Guides tries to use consistent impairment ratings across the different organ systems.\n\n\n2.5  Rules for Evaluation\n\n\n2.5a Confidentiality",
  "Section 17 - 3196 chars": "Prior to performing an impairment evaluation, the physician obtains the individual\u2019s consent to share the medical information with other parties that will be reviewing the evaluation. If the evaluating physician is also that person\u2019s treating physician, the physician needs to indicate to the individual which information from his or her medical record will\nbe shared.\n\n\n2.5b Combining Impairment Ratings\nTo determine whole person impairment, the physician should begin with an estimate of the individual\u2019s most significant (primary) impairment and evaluate other impairments in relation to it. It may be necessary for the physician to refer to the criteria and estimates in several chapters if the impairing condition involves several organ systems. Related but separate conditions are rated separately and impairment ratings are combined unless criteria for the second impairment are included in the primary impairment. For example, an individual with an injury causing neurologic and muscular impairment to his upper extremity would be evaluated under the upper extremity criteria in Chapter 16. Any skin impairment due to significant scarring would be rated separately in the skin chapter and combined with the impairment from the upper extremity chapter. Loss of nerve function would be rated within either the musculoskeletal chapters or neurology chapter.\n\nIn the case of two significant yet unrelated conditions, each impairment rating is calculated separately, converted or expressed as a whole person impairment, then combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). The general philosophy of the Combined Values Chart is discussed in Chapter 1.\n\n2.5c Consistency\nConsistency tests are designed to ensure reproducibility and greater accuracy. These measurements, such as one that checks the individual\u2019s lumbosacral spine range of motion (Section 15.9) are good but imperfect indicators of people\u2019s efforts. The physician must use the entire range of clinical skill and judgment when assessing whether or not the measurements or tests results are plausible and consistent with the impairment being evaluated. If, in spite of an observation or test result, the medical evidence appears insufficient to verify that an impairment of a certain magnitude exists, the physician may modify the impairment rating accordingly and then describe and explain the reason for the modification in writing.\n\n\n2.5d Interpolating, Measuring, and Rounding Off\nIn deciding where to place an individual\u2019s impairment rating within a range, the physician needs to consider all the criteria applicable to the condition, which includes performing activities of daily living, and estimate the degree to which the medical impairment interferes with these activities. In some cases, the physician may need additional information to determine where to place an individual in the range.\n\nAs with any biological measurements, some variability and normal fluctuations are inherent in permanent impairment ratings. Two measurements made by the same examiner using the Guides that involve an individual or an individual\u2019s functions would be consistent if they fall within 10% of each other.",
  "Section 18 - 3325 chars": "Measurements should also be consistent between two trained observers or by one observer on two separate occasions, assuming the individual\u2019s condition is stable. Repeating measurements may decrease error and result in a measurement that is closer to average function. The final calculated whole person impairment rating, whether it is based on the evaluation of one organ system or several organ systems, should be rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n2.5e Pain\nThe impairment ratings in the body organ system chapters make allowance for any accompanying pain. Chronic pain, also called chronic pain syndrome, is discussed in the chapter on pain (Chapter 18).\n\n2.5f Using Assistive Devices in Evaluations If an individual\u2019s prosthesis or assistive device can be removed or its use eliminated relatively easily, the physician should usually test and evaluate the organ system without the device. For example, ask the patient to remove a hearing aid before testing auditory acuity. The examiner may choose also to test the system with the assistive device in place and then report both sets of results. The physician may also choose to report alterations in the individual\u2019s organ function with and without use of the device and challenges that are posed by using the device, if any.\n\nIf the assistive device is not easily removable, as with an implanted lens, evaluate the organ system\u2019s functioning with the device in place. Test the visual system with the patient\u2019s glasses or contact lenses in place if they are used.\n\n\n2.5g Adjustments for Effects of Treatment or Lack of Treatment\nIn certain instances, the treatment of an illness may result in apparently total remission of the person\u2019s signs and symptoms. Examples include the treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus with insulin. Yet it is debatable whether, with treatment, the patient has actually regained the previous status of normal good health. In these instances, the physician may choose to increase the impairment estimate by a small percentage (eg, 1% to 3%).\n\nIn some instances, as with organ transplant recipients who are treated with immunity-suppressing pharmaceuticals or persons treated with anticoagulants, the pharmaceuticals themselves may lead to impairments. In such an instance, the physician should use the appropriate parts of the Guides to evaluate impairment related to pharmaceutical effects. If information in the Guides is lacking, the physician may combine an estimated impairment percent based on the severity of the effect, with the primary organ system impairment, by means of the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\nA patient may decline surgical, pharmacologic, or therapeutic treatment of an impairment. If a patient declines therapy for a permanent impairment, that decision neither decreases nor increases the estimated percentage of the individual\u2019s impairment. However, the physician may wish to make a written comment in the medical evaluation report about the suitability of the therapeutic approach and describe the basis of the individual\u2019s refusal. The physician may also need to address whether the impairment is at maximal medical improvement without treatment and the degree of anticipated improvement that could be expected with treatment.",
  "Section 19 - 3296 chars": "2.5h Changes in Impairment from Prior Ratings\nAlthough a previous evaluator may have considered a medical impairment to be permanent, unanticipated changes may occur: the condition may have become worse as a result of aggravation or clinical progression, or it may have improved. The physician should assess the current state of the impairment according to the criteria in the Guides. If an individual received an impairment rating from an earlier edition and needs to be reevaluated because of a change in the medical condition, the individual is evaluated according to the latest information pertaining to the condition in the current edition of the Guides.\n\nValid assessment of a change in the impairment estimate would depend on the reliability of the previous estimate and the evidence upon which it was based. If a prior impairment evaluation was not performed, but sufficient historical information is available to currently estimate the prior impairment, the assessment would be performed based on the most recent Guides criteria. However, if the information is insufficient to accurately document the change, then the physician needs to explain that decision and should not estimate a change.\n\nIf apportionment is needed, the analysis must consider the nature of the impairment and its relationship to each alleged causative factor, providing an explanation of the medical basis for all conclusions and opinions. (Apportionment and causation are considered more fully in Chapter 1 and are briefly defined in the Glossary.) For example, in apportioning a spine impairment, first the current spine impairment rating is calculated, and then an impairment rating from any preexisting spine problem is calculated. The value for the preexisting impairment rating can be subtracted from the present impairment rating to account for the effects of the intervening injury or disease. Using this approach to apportionment requires accurate information and data to determine both impairment ratings. If different editions of the Guides are used, the physician needs to assess their similarity. If the basis of the ratings is similar, a subtraction is appropriate. If they differ markedly, the physician needs to evaluate the circumstances and determine if conversion to the earlier or latest edition of the Guides for both ratings is possible. The determination should follow any state guidelines and should consider whichever edition best describes the individual\u2019s impairment.\n\n\n2.6 Preparing Reports\nA clear, accurate, and complete report is essential to support a rating of permanent impairment. The following elements in bold type should be included in all impairment evaluation reports. Other elements listed in italics are commonly found within an IME or may be requested for inclusion in an impairment evaluation.\n\n2.6a Clinical Evaluation\n\n2.6a.1 Include a narrative history of the medical condition(s) with the onset and course of the condition, symptoms, findings on previous examination(s), treatments, and responses to treatment, including adverse effects.

The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, the aorta, the systemic arteries, and the pulmonary arteries. Impairment of the heart is the focus of this chapter; impairment of diseases of the aorta, the systemic arteries, and pulmonary arteries (including coronary and peripheral circulation) are included in Chapter 4.\n\nThe following sections have been revised from the fourth edition: (1) information about valvular heart disease reflecting newly published guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology; (2) information about coronary artery disease reflecting the important prognostic impact of left ventricular function on impairment in individuals with coronary artery disease, and the inclusion of silent ischemia and coronary artery spasm with regard to impairment; and (3) information about cardiomyopathy, including the impact of HIV-related conditions that affect cardiac function.\n\n3.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.\n\n\n3.1 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs Some impairment classes refer to limitations in the ability to perform daily activities because of symptoms. When this information is subjective and possibly misinterpreted, it should not serve as the sole criterion upon which decisions about impairment are made. Rather, the examiner should obtain objective data about the extent of the limitation and integrate the findings with the subjective data to estimate the degree of permanent impairment. See the functional classifications of cardiac disease in Table 3-1.\n\nExercise Testing\nWhen feasible, the physician should attempt to quantify limitations due to symptoms by observing the individual during exercise.2 A motor-driven treadmill with varying grades and speeds is the most widely used device for standardized exercise protocols. The protocols vary slightly, but they all attempt to relate the exercise to excess energy expended and to functional class. The excess energy expended is usually expressed in terms of the \u201cMET,\u201d which represents the multiples of resting metabolic energy used for any given activity. One MET is considered to be",
  "Section 22 - 3203 chars": "3.5 mL (kg/min). The 70-kg man who burns 1.2 kcal/min while sitting at rest uses approximately 3 METS when walking 4 km/h.\n\nTable 3-2 displays the relationship of excess energy expenditures in METS to functional class according to the protocols of several investigators. With all protocols, the exercise periods last for 2 or 3 minutes; the time periods are represented in the table by boxes with numbers giving the estimated METS involved.\nA major problem with the use of any exercise-testing technique to attempt to quantify an individual\u2019s functional capacity is the marked variability in people\u2019s efforts and abilities. Therefore, while measuring the maximum oxygen consumption response, the health care professional should estimate and note the individual\u2019s cooperation and effort during the test; eg, some will continue longer than they should, while others will stop after minimal effort because they feel fatigued.\n\nFunctional Capacity\nThe functional capacity of an individual depends on age, gender, and level of training. The functional class determined by means of Tables 3-2 and 3-3 may not be applicable to people at the ends of the age spectrum, such as a 20-year-old athlete or an inactive 70-year-old woman. Therefore, it may be useful to calculate a \u201cpercentage functional aerobic capacity\u201d that is achieved on an exercise test.\nStandard charts are available for the various exercise protocols that determine the percentage functional aerobic capacity based on total exercise duration, age, gender, and level of training.4\n\nLeft Ventricle Function\nKnowledge of the status of the left ventricle is important to assess in the examination and evaluation of an individual with cardiac disease. Two phases of left ventricular (LV) function contribute to the person\u2019s symptoms and condition: systolic function, which is the ability of the heart to pump out blood during contraction; and diastolic function, the process by which the heart fills with blood during relaxation of the myocardium and a passive filling phase.5\n\nEjection Fraction\nA clinically used measure of systolic function is the \u201cejection fraction\u201d (EF), the percentage of blood the heart is able to eject during one beat. Echocardiography, radionuclide angiography, and left ventriculography are commonly used to measure the EF. A normal EF is greater than to 0.50; EFs of 0.40 to\n\n0.50 indicate mild systolic dysfunction; 0.30 to 0.40, moderate systolic dysfunction; and < 0.30, severe systolic dysfunction.\n\nDiastolic Dysfunction\nDiastolic dysfunction may contribute to the signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF), but quantifying the degree of dysfunction is problematic. Diastolic dysfunction is usually diagnosed clinically by elevated filling pressures that result in HF in the absence of systolic dysfunction or valvular abnormalities.\nEchocardiography with cardiac Doppler is emerging as an accepted tool for the assessment of diastolic function.3, 5-7\n\n\n3.1b Determination of Impairment Impairment classes, as listed in Tables 3-5 through 3-11, are disease-specific and based on the NYHA classification system as listed in Table 3-1. The impairment classes reflect anatomic, physiologic,",
  "Section 23 - 3318 chars": "and functional abnormalities. For example, the information in Table 3-1 category I of the NYHA system is represented in the corresponding class 1 on Table 3-5. The classes listed in Tables 3-5 through 3-11 apply the NYHA functional classification to specific disease conditions. The percentages of impairment reflect the severity of the condition and the extent to which the condition limits the abilities to do activities of daily living.\n\nIn the illustrative examples of impairment in this chapter, any historic, physical examination, or laboratory information or data not described should be considered to be within normal limits.\n\nIn summary, an evaluation of the cardiovascular system that falls within normal range reflects an individual who performs all activities of daily living without cardiovascular symptoms, has some reserve capacity that allows comfortable exercise without the development of major cardiovascular symptoms, has an LV ejection fraction that falls within normal limits, and completes at least 80% of ageand gender-predicted functional aerobic capacity during exercise stress testing.\n\n\n3.2 Valvular Heart Disease\nCongenital, rheumatic, infectious, or traumatic factors or a combination of those factors may cause valvular heart disease. Valvular disease may result in\n(1) pressure hypertrophy of the left or right ventricle (RV), causing elevated filling pressures, myocardial ischemia, and eventual LV dysfunction with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF);\n(2) volume hypertrophy of the LV or RV, causing ventricular dilatation and eventual irreversible myocardial dysfunction with signs and symptoms of CHF; (3) inflow obstruction to the ventricles causing congestion of organs, even in the absence of ventricular dysfunction; or (4) decreased cardiac output.5\n\nValvular heart disease can be detected and its severity assessed by means of a thorough history and physical examination and should be confirmed by either Doppler echocardiography or cardiac catheterization.8 A valve gradient measures the pressure drop across a stenotic valve and is proportional to the severity of obstruction. Since the valve gradient is influenced by the cardiac output, the valve gradient calculates a valve area that takes into consideration both the pressure gradient and the cardiac output.\nThere may be technical limitations to these derived variables. Their correlation with the severity of the stenosis is shown in Table 3-4.\n\nThe severity of a regurgitant valve lesion is more difficult to assess than that of a stenotic lesion. Physical examination and Doppler echocardiography may provide a qualitative assessment. Although Doppler echocardiography may help the physician determine a mild or severe regurgitant valve lesion, this technique\u2019s inherent limitations preclude an accurate assessment of intermediate grades of severity.\nCardiac catheterization may be required for a semiquantitative estimate of the valve lesion\u2019s severity; it can provide a view of the contrast medium\u2019s intensity as it crosses the regurgitating valve into the receiving heart chamber. To assess the severity of aortic valve regurgitation, obtain the estimate with aortic root angiography; to assess the severity of mitral valve regurgitation, obtain the estimate with left ventriculography.",
  "Section 24 - 3218 chars": "Catheter-based interventional procedures, operative repair, or prosthetic valve replacement can reduce the severity of, but not fully repair, valvular heart disease. After any of these procedures, allow sufficient time to elapse from the date of surgery for\nmaximum recovery and reconditioning of the heart, lungs, and other organs before estimating permanent impairment.\n\nIn addition, because medication may affect the severity of valvular heart disease, especially limitations due to symptoms, allow sufficient time for medication to be introduced and adjusted and to take effect before estimating permanent impairment.\n\n\n3.2 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Valvular Heart Disease The impairment criteria for valvular heart disease are given in Table 3-5.\n\nChest roentgenogram: normal.\nDiagnosis: Asymptomatic mild aortic stenosis secondary to a bicuspid aortic valve with electrocardiographic evidence of LV hypertrophy.\nImpairment Rating: 1% to 9% impairment of the whole person.\nComment: Antibiotic prophylaxis before dental or surgical procedure to minimize risk of bacterial endocarditis. Periodic cardiac follow-up for progression of aortic stenosis. Aortic valve surgery necessary later in life.\n\nComment: Impairment greater if (1) a diastolic decrescendo murmur; (2) the systolic gradient across the prosthesis > Doppler-derived normal values for the type of prosthesis; or (3) mild recurrent dyspnea. Cardiac catheterization not necessary for estimate.\n\nimpairment due to hypertension per Table 4-2.\nroentgenogram: slight prominence heart apex; prosthesis properly positioned: no evidence of pulmonary congestion. Echocardiogram: normal size ventricles; thickening of LV wall; prosthesis properly positioned, mean gradient 10 mm Hg across the prosthesis; slight regurgitation.

Other causes of limited or reduced coronary blood flow include coronary artery spasm, emboli, congenital abnormalities, and trauma. Inflammatory processes and arthritis also can obstruct the coronary arteries, especially the coronary ostia.",
  "Section 25 - 3175 chars": "Reduced coronary flow resulting in transient ischemia or in permanent injury to the myocardium causes angina pectoris, which may impair a person\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living. Infarction or diffuse fibrosis and a decrease in EF causes permanent injury. The degree of the patient\u2019s impairment is determined by the consequences of both the reduced coronary blood flow and the reduced ventricular function. In addition, reduced coronary blood flow and myocardial damage may cause cardiac arrhythmias. (See Section 3.6).9\n\nThe physician must obtain a detailed history to estimate the degree of impairment due to CHD. The physical examination contributes to the estimate of the disorder\u2019s severity, and especially to the estimate of the degree of ventricular function impairment. In most individuals, laboratory studies will also be necessary. Studies obtained at rest, during exercise, and after exercise are especially useful in examining people suspected of having CHD. Knowledge of ventricular function should usually be obtained for all individuals. If there is a normal examination, normal heart size on chest x-ray, and normal resting ECG, the EF should be normal. Coronary angiography may be necessary in some.2,6, 10\n\nExercise training programs, cessation of cigarette smoking, use of medications, and surgical procedures can reduce but not eliminate impairment due to CHD.

Many of these surgically treated patients continue to have less than normal functioning of the heart and circulation and are therefore impaired.11\n\nCongenital heart disease may be recognized by medical history and physical examination, but often the exact diagnosis and the individual\u2019s functional\n\nimpairment require special studies, including ECG, chest roentgenogram, radioisotope studies, echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, and angiography.12 The functional classification of cardiac disease found in Table 3-1 is used in the classification for congenital heart disease listed below in Table 3-8.\n\n\n3.4 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Congenital Heart Disease\nImpairment criteria for congenital heart disease are given in Table 3-8.\n\n\n3/6 systolic murmur ends well short of S , loudest in second left intercostal space; early systolic click varies with respiration.

Abnormal ventricular function may be the result of (1) systolic dysfunction, (2) diastolic dysfunction, or (3) a combination of both. An individual with these abnormalities may be asymptomatic or symptomatic due to pulmonary or systemic organ congestion and decreased cardiac output. In people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a dynamic outflow tract obstruction and secondary mitral regurgitation may cause symptoms of exertional dyspnea, angina, and syncope. Because some cardiomyopathies are reversible, every effort should be made to identify the reversible forms and to treat\n\nthem appropriately and prevent further deterioration. When the conditions are stable, the individual may be evaluated in terms of permanent impairment.13-18\n\nCardiomyopathies arise from many mechanisms, but the conditions may be divided into three major types:\n(1) dilated or congestive, (2) hypertrophic, and\n(3) restrictive. Careful history-taking and physical examination can reveal cardiomyopathies, but it is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis with echocardiography and selected laboratory studies.\n\n\n3.5 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Cardiomyopathies Impairment criteria for cardiomyopathies are given in Table 3-9.\n\nDiagnosis: Idiopathic cardiomyopathy.\nImpairment Rating: 49% impairment of the whole person.\nComment: Reduced exercise capacity; poor LV function.\n\n\n3.6 Pericardial Heart Disease\nInflammation from diseases of the pericardium is associated with (1) systemic illnesses such as lupus erythematosus; (2) a reaction to mechanical forces, such as trauma or irradiation; (3) no obvious cause (idiopathic pericarditis); (4) infections, eg, viral, bacterial, fungal; or (5) open heart surgery (postcardiotomy syndrome). The pericardium may also be affected by tumors.",
  "Section 28 - 3089 chars": "Recurrent pericarditis can lead to disabling episodes of fevers and pleuritic chest pain. Since chest pain is nonspecific, pericarditis evidence must be documented by echocardiography to show a pericardial effusion or by laboratory evidence of active inflammation, such as an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\n\nConstrictive pericarditis is the most common pericardial disorder leading to permanent impairment; surgical removal of the thickened pericardium may significantly reduce symptoms and improve the overall condition of the individual. Before assessing permanent impairment, it is mandatory to allow sufficient time for the person to recover from a surgical procedure and to reach maximal medical improvement.\n\nPain and compromised cardiac function because of tamponade may cause some impairment, but they are rare as causes of permanent impairment. Recurrent episodes of pericarditis with tamponade or pericardial disease related to tumors may lead to permanent impairment. Allow adequate time for resolution of an acute illness, generally a period of months, before assessing permanent impairment.\n\nDiagnosis of pericardial disease is made by historytaking; identifying a pericardial fraction rub or early diastolic pericardial knock; demonstrating pericardial effusion, thickening, or calcification on an echocardiogram; showing a thickened pericardium with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); or findings at cardiac catheterization.\n\n\n3.6 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Pericardial Heart Disease\nCriteria for evaluating permanent impairment related to pericardial heart disease are given in Table 3-10.\n\nImpairment Rating: 0% impairment of the whole person.\nComment: Self-limited illness; no effects on activities of daily living.\n\n\n3.7  Arrhythmias\nAn arrhythmia is one or more heartbeats generated at a site other than the sinus node. An impulse generated in the sinus node but not transmitted normally through the conducting system is a conduction defect arrhythmia. Arrhythmias may occur in individuals with structurally and functionally normal hearts or in those with any type of organic heart disease.\n\nBecause arrhythmias tend to fluctuate remarkably in frequency, the physician must adequately document and estimate the frequency with which an arrhythmia occurs. The associated symptoms can include syncope, weakness and fatigue, palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath, alone or in any combination.\n\nThe degree of impairment from cardiac arrhythmias often has to be combined with the degree of impairment due to underlying heart disease and then calculated according to the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). Before estimating the degree of permanent impairment, allow adequate time for the individual\u2019s condition to reach maximal medical improvement after instituting therapy.19\n\n\n3.7 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Arrhythmias Criteria for evaluating impairments related to arrhythmias are given in Table 3-11.",

The information regarding medical evaluation, analysis of findings, and impairment criteria in Chapter 3, The Cardiovascular System: Heart and Aorta, remain applicable for this chapter. See Table 3-1 for the functional classification of cardiac disease.\n\nThis chapter also integrates new findings in the rapidly changing specialty of cardiovascular disease. The following areas are new or revised from the fourth edition: (a) the addition of recent guidelines of the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-6)1; (b) an expanded section on pulmonary hypertension that outlines guides for impairment assessment; and (c) the latest data for prognosis of individuals with pulmonary hypertension.\n\n4.1 Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease\nThe JNC-6 classifies hypertension, or elevated blood pressure, as an elevation of the systolic blood pressure to ? 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure to\n>89 mm Hg on two or more separate readings.1 (See Table 4-1 for the JNC-6 three-stage hypertension classification.) Hypertension, the leading cause of ambulatory office visits in the United States, can produce heart disease, stroke, and renal failure. The economic impact of heart disease and stroke exceeds\n$29 billion annually in the United States. The prevalence of hypertension and its complications make it a major public health concern, particularly in the Southeast and among African Americans.2,3\n\n\nHypertensive heart disease includes hypertension, hypertension-associated systolic and diastolic heart failure (HF), hypertension-associated angina, and hypertension-induced left ventricular (LV)\nhypertrophy. Hypertensive heart disease can be very debilitating and demands aggressive treatment.\nPreventive treatment strategies may reduce the risk of developing secondary cardiac changes, the symptoms associated with hypertension, and other organ dysfunction.4-7\n\n\n4.1 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease\nTable 4-2 addresses the impairment classification for hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular complications of hypertension should be established before assigning a diagnosis of hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

Note: Impairment class corresponds to cardiomyopathy impairment in Chapter 3. Here, the class 4 impairment for hypertensive cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not combined with cardiomyopathy since hypertensive CVD class 4 includes cardiomyopathy.\n\n\n4.2 Diseases of the Aorta\nDiseases of the aorta, less prevalent than heart disease, can be more acutely life threatening. Diseases of the aorta include atherosclerotic dilatation, dilatation and/or stenosis from a concurrent connective tissue disease or vasculitis, and atheroembolic complications from diffuse aortic atherosclerosis.\n\nAortic atherosclerotic dilatation can progress to a significant degree and cause dyspnea, wheezing, cough, recurrent pneumonia, and hemoptysis. Aortic dilatation can be associated with significant aortic regurgitation and can also enlarge to the point of rupture and death.\n\nThe physician must obtain a careful and detailed history to estimate aortic involvement. Physical examination and chest roentgenogram may suggest aortic enlargement, but often a more advanced imaging assessment is necessary. MRI, CT scan, and transesophageal imaging identify aortic aneurysms, aortic vasculitic involvement, and atheromatous emboli sources. Laboratory studies help establish the presence of atheroemboli.8-13\n\n\n4.2 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Diseases of the Aorta See Table 4-3 for the classification of whole person impairment due to diseases of the aorta.\n\n\n4.3 Vascular Diseases Affecting the Extremities",

The venous system is most frequently affected by varicose veins, thrombosis, and chronic deep venous insufficiency. The lymphatic system may become impaired by inflammatory or neoplastic processes.\n\nNoninvasive laboratory studies are valuable in confirming occlusive arterial disease or venous abnormalities of the extremities. To estimate functional impairment due to occlusive peripheral arterial disease, determine ankle or arm systolic pressure indices before, and 1 minute after, standard exercise (eg, walking on a treadmill at 2 miles per hour at a 10% grade for 5 minutes, or something less strenuous if the individual\u2019s symptoms warrant it).14, 15\n\nBefore evaluating impairment, establish a specific diagnosis of vascular disease. The impairment estimate depends on the extent, severity, and impact of the lesions rather than on the specific diagnosis.\n\nTable 4-4 provides a classification of impairments due to peripheral vascular disease. Physical signs of vascular damage must be present and are the primary\n\ndeterminants in placing the the examinee into one of these classes. Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon consists of localized blanching of one or more fingers, followed by a period of cyanosis, followed by erythema. Pain on exposure to cold or generalized paleness of the fingers on exposure to cold do not in themselves indicate Raynuad\u2019s. When amputation due to peripheral vascular disease is involved, the impairment due to amputation should be evaluated separately and combined with the appropriate value in Table 4-4 using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\nIt is important to differentiate Raynaud\u2019s symptoms on the basis of obstructive physiology from those occurring because of vasoreactivity. Individuals with obstructive physiology will often experience symptoms more frequently and to a greater degree of severity. Establish the presence of obstructive physiology by objective testing. Arterial pressure ratios between the affected digits and the brachial pressure (finger/brachial index) are easily performed. A ratio of < 0.8 suggests obstructive physiology, even if Raynaud\u2019s symptoms are not present. Obstuctive physiology can also be established by the use of cutaneous laser Doppler flowmetry. This technique is established and can reliably assess microcirculation performance and real time changes in skin blood flow.16",

Pulmonary venous and capillary system disorders can also produce pulmonary hypertension. All of these disorders are classified disorders of the pulmonary circulation for impairment assessment.\n\nThe physician should take a careful history of functional impairment and symptoms for individuals with pulmonary hypertension. Classic findings include a right ventricular (RV) lift and an increased intensity of the S pulmonic component. Pulmonary hypertension is often diagnosed by chest roentgenogram changes, RV hypertrophy, or ECG strain. The definitive\n\nassessment of pulmonary hypertension is made by PAP assessment with an echocardiogram or right heart catheterization.17-20\n\n\n4.4 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Pulmonary Hypertension\nThe degree of pulmonary hypertension can be classified by the measurement of PAP or PA resistance.\nImpairment classification should be based on more than the observed PAP; also consider the presence or absence of signs and symptoms of right HF.

  "Section 33 - 4026 chars": "Introduction\nThis chapter provides criteria for evaluating permanent impairment of the respiratory system as it affects overall lung function and the ability to per-\nform the activities of daily living. The respiratory system includes the tracheobronchial tree, pulmonary parenchyma, and ribcage.\n\nThe following sections have been revised for the fifth edition: (1) criteria for asthma impairment were updated to incorporate guidelines recently published by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)1; (2) respiratory impairment criteria now incorporate the lower limits of normal2 for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DCO); and (3) the section on sleep apnea has been updated to reflect current assessment and practice.\n\n5.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluations.\n\nThe purpose of respiratory impairment assessment is to determine if a permanent respiratory impairment exists, quantify its severity, assess its impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living, and, if possible, identify the cause of the abnormality and recommend measures to prevent further impairment and ensure optimum function.\n\nAn impairment, as stated in Chapter 1, is \u201ca loss, loss of use, or derangement of any body part, organ system, or organ function\u201d (Table 1-1). Not all impairments result in a functional loss or affect the ability to perform activities of daily living. Respiratory impairments that produce a decrement of lung function and affect the ability to perform activities of daily living are assigned an impairment rating. For example, an anatomic change such as a circumscribed pleural plaque would be an impairment based on an abnormality in anatomic structure. However, if there were no abnormality in lung function and no decrease in the ability to perform activities of daily living, the individual would be assigned a 0% impairment rating.\n\nChanges in organ function are the primary criteria for determining the impairment class. To establish the specific impairment percentage, consider both the severity and prognosis of the condition and how the impairment affects the individual\u2019s ability to perform the activities of daily living listed in Table 1-2. Table 5-13 is provided at the end of the chapter to ensure all pertinent information is included in the respiratory assessment.\n\nBegin the evaluation with an inquiry into specific symptoms and their severity, duration, and manner of onset. Since environmental exposure frequently leads to symptomatic complaints, it is important to determine if the individual\u2019s personal habits or surroundings, such as cigarette smoking and workplace exposures, explain or contribute to the symptoms. A thorough history enables the examiner to direct the physical examination to areas of concern and then identify the most useful diagnostic and evaluative studies. For instance, structural and movement disorders of the chest wall or diaphragm found on physical examination would prompt different investigations than an observation of wheezing. Radiographic techniques such as chest roentgenograms or computed tomography (CT) scans help elucidate anatomic abnormalities that are sometimes diagnostic of specific disease processes. To assess impairment, weigh both subjective and objective information derived from thorough history-taking, physical examination, imaging and laboratory studies, and pulmonary function tests. These complementary evaluation techniques enable the examiner to obtain an accurate and thorough view of the impairment\u2019s nature, as well as the individual\u2019s limitations and ability to perform activities of daily living.",
  "Section 34 - 3056 chars": "5.1 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs Symptomatic assessment of individuals with respiratory disease is diagnostically useful, but it provides limited quantitative information and should not serve as the sole criterion upon which to make decisions about impairment. Rather, the examiner should obtain objective data about the extent of the limitation and integrate those findings with the subjective data to estimate the degree of permanent impairment.\n\n\n5.1 b Description of Clinical Studies Clinical studies used to assess pulmonary impairment include radiographs; other imaging studies, including CT scans and MR images; pulmonary function tests; and exercise testing. Pulmonary function tests are the most useful in assessing functional changes.\n\n\n5.2 Symptoms Associated With Respiratory Disease\nThe major symptoms of pulmonary disease include dyspnea; cough, sputum production, and hemoptysis; wheezing; and chest pain or tightness. The examiner needs to document these symptoms and their course over time, and correlate the symptoms with objective studies to assess their importance and implications. The significance of respiratory symptoms is better understood when integrated with findings from more objective measures such as the physical examination, radiography, lung function, and laboratory studies.\n\n\n5.2 a Dyspnea\nDyspnea is the most common symptom noted on initial examination of individuals with any type of pulmonary impairment. Despite its importance, dyspnea is nonspecific; it is often caused by cardiac, hematologic, metabolic, or neurologic disease, or by anxiety or physical deconditioning.\n\nDyspnea can be evaluated and quantitated using several systems. The most widely used classification system, developed with the ATS, (Table 5-1), is based on the American Thoracic Society/Division of Lung Diseases Respiratory Symptom questionnaire.3 The ATS classification is best used in conjunction with more objective respiratory function measurements. If a disparity is found between subjective complaints of dyspnea and findings on respiratory testing, consider a nonrespiratory dyspnea component.4\n\n\n5.2\nb Cough, Sputum Production, and Hemoptysis\nCoughing can be an important indicator of respiratory tract disease, although it is difficult to quantify and not easily measured. Document its presence or absence, whether it is productive or nonproductive of sputum, its relationship to work or other activities, its duration, its association with hemoptysis, and whether further investigation is warranted.\n\nAn acute, self-limited cough is most commonly due to infection or irritation. A subacute or recurrent, nonproductive cough may be a manifestation of asthma and should be investigated with pulmonary function testing. A chronic, productive cough may indicate bronchitis. According to ATS criteria, the term chronic bronchitis may be used to describe a sputum-producing cough that occurs on most days for at least 3 consecutive months a year for at least 2 consecutive years.4",
  "Section 35 - 3065 chars": "Hemoptysis frequently accompanies bronchitis and pneumonia, usually as blood-streaked sputum.\nSerious conditions that often manifest with hemoptysis include bronchogenic carcinoma, pulmonary emboli, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, aspergilloma, and arteriovenous malformations. At a minimum, hemoptysis requires radiologic evaluation that may uncover respiratory or other impairment-producing types of diseases.\n\n\n5.2 c Wheezing\nSubjects with partial airway obstruction often report high-pitched, musical sounds, or wheezing. These sounds can be generated at any point along the respiratory tract from the glottis to the bronchioles.\nInspiratory wheezing, or stridor, suggests laryngeal disease; expiratory wheezing indicates bronchospasm or localized bronchial narrowing.\nInformation about seasonal wheezing is also diagnostically significant. Wheezing and/or cough occurring primarily in the workplace or having a definite temporal relationship to work suggests occupational asthma; wheezing that follows several minutes of exercise suggests exercise-induced asthma; and wheezing that usually accompanies respiratory tract infections is classified as asthmatic bronchitis. While these different varieties of asthma are commonly described as separate entities, there is substantial overlap among the syndromes. This is due to the underlying commonalities of airway hyperresponsiveness in all types of asthma.\n\n\n5.2 d Thoracic Cage Abnormalities\nOsseous spine abnormalities may produce respiratory impairment due to mechanical factors involving the size of the chest cavity and restriction of rib motion. Kyphoscoliosis, the most common of these abnormalities, is characterized by curvature of the vertebral column from side to side in the frontal plane (scoliosis) and from the dorsal to the ventral aspect of the sagittal plane (kyphosis). The Cobb method is the most common measurement tool for curvature severity. With this method, posteroanterior and lateral spinal radiographs measure the curvature angles. Only severe curvature angles\u2014that is, Cobb angles that are greater than 100\u00b0\u2014are likely to lead to respiratory failure. Even when there are severe spinal deformities, respiratory decompensation usually does not occur until middle age or later.\n\nWith severe spinal abnormalities, respiratory compromise is produced by the combined effects of restricted lung volume, decreased cross-sectional area of the vascular bed, and age-related decrease in chest wall compliance. Progressive stiffness of the chest wall with advancing age increases the work of breathing and leads to hypoventilation, which produces hypoxia and hypercapnia. Hypoxia is a powerful pulmonary vasoconstrictor and further decreases the vascular cross-sectional area, eventually leading to cor pulmonale. Judge the severity of respiratory impairment on the criteria described in the sections on forced respiratory maneuvers (5.4d), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (5.4e), and the criteria for rating impairment due to respiratory disease (5.4g) in this chapter.",

Although susceptibility to the adverse effects of cigarette smoke varies, there is a discernible dose-response relationship. The examiner\n\nshould ask the individual\u2019s current age; the age at which he or she started smoking; the average number of packs smoked per day if the smoking has continued; and, if the person quit smoking at any time, the age and date he or she quit smoking.\n\nMultiply the number of years of smoking by the number of packs smoked per day to produce the standard measure of pack-years of cigarette smoking. Use this information to assess the impact of personal habits on respiratory impairment. Cigarette smoking is the most frequent causative factor in the development of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer, and it can exacerbate asthma. Chronic exposure to environmental tobacco smoke may also be a factor in the origin of lung cancer, and it can also exacerbate asthma. Smoking cessation should be noted since it often benefits respiratory status.\nAlthough the anatomic abnormalities of emphysema are irreversible, both bronchospasm and productive cough can be favorably affected by the discontinuation of cigarette use. In addition, risk of bronchogenic carcinoma decreases progressively in the first 10 to 15 years after quitting smoking. After that time, the risk stabilizes at a point slightly higher than that of someone who has never smoked.5\n\n\n5.3 b Environmental Exposure Environmental exposures in the workplace often are cited as causative or contributory factors in the development of respiratory impairment. It is impor-\ntant to obtain a complete occupational history from the individual to evaluate the possible effect of these exposures. A chief component of the history contains a chronological description of work activities beginning with the first year of employment and includes names of employers, the specific types of work performed, the materials used by the person, and the potentially toxic materials present in the workplace. Employers are required to maintain a list (made available to the employee and the treating physician in the form of Material Safety Data Sheets) of potentially toxic materials used in the workplace, their chemical descriptions, and their physical and health hazards. This information can be quite helpful to the examiner to direct the diagnostic and evaluative process. To assess its significance, ask the individual to estimate the frequency and intensity of exposure to each substance, as well as information about the use of respiratory protective devices.\n\nRespiratory injuries in the workplace can occur in several different patterns, depending on the nature of the inhaled material and the circumstances of exposure. Acute lung injury may be the result of inhalation of a highly irritative gas, fume, mist, or vapor that results in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome. If the individual survives the acute lung injury, the healing process may produce diffuse pulmonary fibrosis or obliterative bronchiolitis, which may lead to functional impairment. Depending on the nature, duration, and intensity of exposure, inhalation of irritative substances can cause subsequent persistent problems such as chronic bronchitis and airway hyperreactivity. Allergic pulmonary reactions can result from inhalation of organic material or certain types of reactive chemical molecules, causing asthma or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Inhalation of fibrogenic dust can cause pneumoconiosis over a prolonged period. Workplace exposures can also exacerbate underlying conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema.",
  "Section 37 - 3558 chars": "In addition to information on workplace exposure, inquire about home and environmental exposure (including hobbies or leisure time activities) to organic and inorganic agents such as allergens, bioaerosols, paints, glues, or pesticides. In the home, exposure to pets and use of cool-mist vaporizers, humidifiers, and indoor hot tubs also may be associated with respiratory disease.\n\n\n5.4 Examinations, Clinical Studies, and Other Tests for Evaluating Respiratory Disease\n\n5.4 a Physical Examination\nAlthough a thorough physical examination is mandatory to reach valid conclusions about an individual\u2019s impairment, certain portions of the examination are particularly pertinent in evaluating the respiratory system. Observe and record respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles, and body habitus. Noisy breath sounds are a physical finding that may indicate\n\nairflow obstruction. A breathing pattern characterized by pursed lip breathing during expiration suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Inspect the thoracic cage for vertebral or rib cage deformity and movement of the ribs with inspiration and expiration. A barrel-shaped chest may indicate hyperinflation. Percuss the chest to ascertain hyperresonance or consolidation and assess diaphragmatic motion.\n\nChest auscultation detects decreased breath sounds, crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. Describe the intensity, quality, and location of these, as well as whether they are heard during inspiration, expiration, or both.\nInspiratory crackles, heard in two thirds of people with chronic interstitial lung disease, may be associated with restrictive respiratory impairment. Wheezes and rhonchi are indicative of bronchial abnormalities and are often accompanied by obstructive airway disease. Auscultate during both quiet breathing and forced expiration before excluding wheezing.\nDiffuse, bilateral, expiratory wheezing indicates generalized bronchospasm, while unilateral or localized wheezing may be caused by partial bronchial obstruction due to an endobronchial tumor or mucus plugging. Early inspiratory crackles or opening snaps may be heard in diseases of airflow obstruction and particularly in bronchiolitis obliterans.\n\nCyanosis, indicated by a bluish tint of the lips and nail beds, is a striking but unreliable indicator of severe pulmonary impairment. Poor lighting in the examination room, anemia, and skin pigmentation can interfere with assessment of severity. Suspicion of cyanosis calls for pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis.\n\nDigital clubbing is characterized by loss of the angle at the junction of the cuticle and the nail, softening of the nail bed, increased curvature of the nails, and widening of the distal portions of the fingers and toes. Chest diseases associated with clubbing include pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, bronchogenic carcinoma, pleural tumors, lung abscess, empyema, and cyanotic congenital heart disease.\n\n\n5.4 b Chest Roentgenograms\nThe initial radiographic examination should include posteroanterior and lateral views of the chest taken in full inspiration. Chest radiographic findings often correlate poorly with physiologic findings in diseases with airflow limitation, such as asthma and emphysema. Chronic radiographic abnormalities of the chest may be classified as parenchymal, bronchovascular, cardiovascular, pleural, or osseous. Mediastinal or tracheal changes may be observed. Terms used to describe parenchymal changes can be classified as hyperinflation, fibrosis, cavitary, or cystic.",
  "Section 38 - 3312 chars": "Hyperinflation is characteristic of airway obstruction. Radiographic findings of hyperinflation are seen in airway obstruction, while volume restriction is associated with fibrosis, loss of chest wall compliance, or severe neuromuscular weakness. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is manifested radiographically by diaphragm flattening, attenuation of pulmonary vasculature within the parenchyma, increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest, and increased retrosternal air space. An individual with an acute asthmatic attack can have radiographic evidence of hyperinflation without parenchymal vascular attenuation; when the asthmatic attack dissipates, the radiographic appearance reverts to normal.\n\nDiffuse fibrotic changes in the pulmonary parenchyma may appear linear (streaky) and/or nodular (rounded). Specific diagnostic information is obtained by noting both the type and the predominant location of fibrotic changes and whether they are focal or diffuse. For example, silicosis is manifested by nodular opacities that predominate in the upper portions of the chest, while asbestosis is manifested by linear opacities that typically are most marked in lower portions of the lungs. Pleural changes such as pleural plaques may also be present in individuals with asbestosis or may be the sole manifestation of past asbestos exposure.\n\nThe International Labor Organization (ILO) adopted a standardized method of classifying radiographic abnormalities associated with fibrotic changes caused by pneumoconiosis.6 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) regularly administers a course and examination to certify knowledge and proficiency in the use of this method. Information on courses and programs can be obtained from the NIOSH Division of Respiratory Disease Studies, Morgantown, WVa, or by calling 800 35-NIOSH.\n\nEvidence of cardiovascular abnormalities associated with chronic pulmonary disease is suggested when chest films show evidence of pulmonary hypertension and/or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension is indicated by enlargement of pulmonary arteries in the hila and rapid tapering of the peripheral vessels. Cor pulmonale presents as an enlargement of the right ventricle and the radiographic indicators of pulmonary hypertension. The presence of pulmonary hypertension and/or cor pulmonale and the severity of those processes may need to be confirmed by additional clinical and laboratory tests.\n\n\n5.4c Computed Tomography\nComputed tomography (CT) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) are radiographic techniques than can augment the standard chest radiograph and are more sensitive in evaluating certain pulmonary diseases such as asbestosis. Conventional CT is obtained using 10-mm-thick slices through various lung fields. This technique is good for evaluating nodules with high radiographic attenuation.\nThe HRCT, which consists of 1to 2-mm thick slices every 10 mm, is useful for evaluating changes with low radiographic attenuation such as early interstitial lung disease. The standard CT and/or HRCT can provide greater accuracy as part of a thorough assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma. It should be noted that, in general, the HRCT delivers significantly less whole body effective dose radiation than the standard CT.",
  "Section 39 - 3196 chars": "With regard to airway disease, HRCT can detect early changes in the lung consistent with focal emphysema; regional air trapping associated with small airway disease, such as obliterative bronchiolitis; and large airway abnormalities, such as bronchiectasis. For example, air trapping of the type seen with obliterative bronchiolitis is best demonstrated by comparing full inspiratory and full expiratory scans. Prone and supine position scans also are helpful in distinguishing hydrostatic changes related to blood volume that are transient and can occur in the dependent position of the lungs from fixed parenchymal abnormalities.7,8\n\n\n5.4d Forced Expiratory Maneuvers (Simple Spirometry)\nPulmonary function tests, performed on standardized equipment with validated administration techniques, provide the framework for evaluation of respiratory system impairment. Spirometric testing equipment, calibration, and administration techniques must conform to the guidelines of the 1994 ATS Statement on Standardization of Spirometry.9\u201315\n\nIf tolerated by the individual, remove pulmonary medications up to 24 hours before spirometry or methacholine challenge testing to assess pulmonary function without the effects of medication.\n\nForced expiratory maneuver measurements are made from at least three acceptable spirometric tracings that demonstrate uniformity pertaining to both the\n\nexpiratory flow pattern and concordance of at least two of the test results within 5% of each other.\nMeasurements include the following: forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and the ratio of these measurements (FEV1/FVC). Use the tracings with the highest FVC and FEV1 to calculate the FEV1/FVC ratio, even if these measurements occur on different expiratory efforts.12-14,16\n\nRepeat spirometry after bronchodilator administration if FEV1/FVC is below 0.70 or if there is wheezing on physical examination. Use the spirogram indicating the best effort, before or after administration of a bronchodilator, to determine FVC and FEV1 for impairment assessment. Postbronchodilator FEV1 and FVC are important in understanding potential medication responsiveness and prognosis.12,14,17,18\n\nIC = inspiratory capacity; VC = vital capacity; TLC = total lung capacity; RV = residual volume; ERV = expiratory reserve volume.\n\nTo use pulmonary function measures, obtain measurements of the FVC, FEV, and DCO and compare these to the predicted normal values as presented in Tables 5-2a through 5-7a. For the average or mean predicted normal value, find the individual\u2019s age in the left-hand column and height along the top row; the predicted value lies at the intersection of the appropriate row and column. In addition, identify the lower limit of normal for the measure of interest by using Tables 5-2b through 5-7b. The lower limit of normal has been calculated based upon the standard convention of the lower limit of normal lying at the fifth percentile, below the upper 95% of the reference population, according to recommendations from the ATS.13,14 The lower limits of normal are used to distinguish between class 1 and class 2 respiratory impairment in Table 5-12.",
  "Section 40 - 3443 chars": "North American whites have larger spirometric values for a given age, height, and gender than North American blacks, with a similar tendency noted for Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asians. Population values of normal lung function have been identified for blacks. The ATS Task Force for Interpretation of Pulmonary Function recommends an adjustment on a population basis for predicted lung function in blacks. Multiply values for predicted normal FVC (Tables\n\n5-2a and 5-3a) by 0.88; for predicted normal FEV1 (Tables 5-4a and 5-5a) by 0.88; and for normal single-breath DCO (Tables 5-6a and 5-7a) by 0.93. In cases where the correction value may not apply, the examiner may choose not to use this correction and instead may provide an explanation why it is inappropriate. Reliable population data are not yet available for other ethnic groups, such as Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asians. For these ethnic groups, the values for North American whites may be used.16,19\u201321\n\nThe FEV1/FVC ratio helps diagnose obstructive airway disease. However, according to the most recent ATS statement on pulmonary function testing interpretation, the absolute volume or the percentage of predicted value of FEV1 is the primary parameter for assessing severity of obstruction, although the FEV1/FVC may be helpful.13 Rather, judge severity on the absolute value or the percentage of predicted value of FEV1.\n\n\n5.4e Diffusing Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DCO)\nUse single-breath DCO to evaluate all levels of impairment. The single-breath DCO testing method is described in a 1995 ATS statement.14,22 The DCO\nmeasurement provides information about gas transfer efficiency across the lungs.23 Several physiologic factors affect the gas transfer process, including alveolar-capillary membrane thickness, available gas exchange surface area, gas solubility, pulmonary capillary blood volume, hematocrit, test gas concentration gradient across the alveolar-capillary membrane, and hemoglobin-binding site availability.\n\nMechanical factors that affect DCO results include test gas inhalation speed, inspiration depth, period of breath holding, and expiration speed. While mechanical factors generally are controlled by DCO test automation, extrapulmonary factors are important to ascertain proper interpretation. For example, cigarette smoking can elevate the blood\u2019s carbon monoxide levels, causing as much as 10% to 12% hemoglobin saturation and decreasing DCO. Instruct the individual not to smoke for at least 8 hours before the test.\n\nSee Tables 5-6a and 5-7a for reference values for population-based predicted normal diffusing capacity. Use these tables in a manner similar to the spirometry tables. A laboratory that tests DCO under conditions or with procedures different than that recommended by the ATS should either develop and verify its own prediction equations or use an accepted and verified equation.\n\nSee Table 5-12 for classification of respiratory impairment based on the testing results of FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and DCO. Also consider the possible contribution of extrapulmonary factors to respiratory system impairment. For example, morbid obesity may decrease FVC, and anemia may decrease DCO. Evaluate other organ system impairments according to the criteria given in other Guides chapters and combine those impairment ratings with the respiratory system impairment rating (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).",
  "Section 41 - 3556 chars": "Table 5-7b Predicted Lower Limit of Normal Diffusing Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DCO) for Women*\n\n\n5.4f Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is sometimes useful in assessing whether an individual\u2019s complaint of dyspnea (see Table 5-1) is a result of respiratory or other conditions. A person\u2019s cardiac and conditioning status must be considered in performing the test and in interpreting the results.\n\nThe cardiopulmonary exercise gas-exchange measurement can be an additional means of assessing the severity and cause of exercise intolerance.\nSimultaneous measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) production, minute ventilation, and heart rate allows determination of whether exercise capacity limitation is due to cardiac, pulmonary, or coexisting impairments. When properly performed and interpreted, these tests can help differentiate pulmonary impairment from cardiac impairment or physical deconditioning effects.24\n\nExercise capacity is measured by oxygen consumption per unit time (V?O2) in milliliters per kilogram multiplied by minutes (mL/[kg\u2022min]) or in metabolic equivalents (METS), a unit of expended energy equal to 3.5 mL/(kg\u2022min) oxygen consumption. MET is discussed in Chapter 3 in the sections on the heart and aorta. Generally, an individual can sustain a work level equal to 40% of his or her measured maximum V?O2 for an 8-hour period.25 Table 5-8 shows the relationship between work intensity and oxygen consumption.\n\nUse cardiopulmonary exercise testing judiciously since these studies can be difficult to perform, are more expensive, and are sometimes more invasive than conventional tests. Ordinarily, exercise capacity measurements are not used to study individuals with normal results on routine pulmonary function tests. However, they can be helpful when the results of pulmonary function tests do not correlate with the\n\nindividual\u2019s symptoms or when additional information is needed to clarify the nature and severity of an impairment.27 Do not use exercise capacity measurements to study individuals with medical contraindications such as unstable cardiac disease.\n\nArterial Blood Gas Analysis\nBecause of its invasive nature, use arterial blood gas analysis only when necessary to evaluate pulmonary impairment. Arterial blood gas analysis results may be outside the normal range for reasons other than pulmonary disease. For most individuals with obstructive lung disease, exercise capacity correlates better with FEV1 than arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). For purposes of evaluating permanent impairment, hypoxia must be measured on two separate occasions at least 4 weeks apart.\n\nPulse oximetry, which is less invasive than arterial blood gas, often provides an adequate estimate of hypoxia. Arterial blood gases, although more invasive, provide a more accurate measurement of hypoxia. Physicians should use their clinical judgment as to which measurement is needed, based on individual assessment.\n\nAn arterial blood gas determination may indicate the presence of severe impairment even when a person\u2019s condition is stable and he or she is receiving optimal therapy. An arterial PO2 of less than 55 mm Hg is evidence of severe impairment when an individual is examined at rest while breathing room air at sea level. Severe impairment may also be diagnosed with an arterial PO2 of less than 60 mm Hg if the person also has one or more of the following conditions: pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, increasingly severe hypoxia during exercise testing, or erythrocytosis.",
  "Section 42 - 3043 chars": "5.4g Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Respiratory Disease\nTable 5-12 presents criteria for estimating the permanent impairment rating for different respiratory conditions, discussed below. Perform spirometry and DCO on each person being evaluated.3 V?O2max may provide additional information in selected individuals when indicated. The person must meet all of the listed criteria except for V?O2max in order to be considered nonimpaired. At least one of the listed criteria must be fulfilled to place an individual in any class with an impairment rating. As discussed in Chapter 1, in individuals where the preinjury or preillness values differ from the population-listed values, the examiner\n\nmay depart from the population-listed normal values for determining an impairment rating, using the preinjury and preillness \u201cnormal\u201d value, and explain the reason for the departure.\n\n\n5.5  Asthma\nAsthma is an airway inflammatory disease characterized by episodic and variable airflow limitation and airway hyperresponsiveness. A diagnosis of asthma requires relevant symptoms (eg, cough, sputum, wheeze, chest tightness, or breathlessness) and either evidence of airflow obstruction that is partially or completely reversible (either spontaneously or after treatment) or airway reactivity to methacholine or histamine in the absence of airflow limitation.10\n\nVariable airflow obstruction can be detected with pulmonary function testing, which shows a reversible obstructive airway pattern. Airway hyperresponsiveness is detected by bronchial challenge testing with methacholine or histamine.28 Airway hyperresponsiveness is defined as a positive methacholine or histamine challenge, as reflected by a decrease in FEV1 of 20% (PC20) from baseline, upon provocation with less than or equal to 8 mg/mL of methacholine or histamine using the tidal breathing method or its equivalent.1,18 The results from methacholine testing should be expressed as the provocation concentration to cause a fall in FEV1 of 20% (PC20).\nWhile different varieties of asthma exist, they all share an underlying commonality of airway hyperresponsiveness. Occupational asthma represents a special subset of asthma subjects. This abnormality has now surpassed pneumoconiosis as the most commonly reported occupational lung disease linked to a particular occupational environment or agent. Besides directly causing occupational asthma, work exposures can acutely exacerbate an underlying asthmatic condition, which can subsequently return to preexposure baseline status with removal from exposure. Work exposures can also cause a more permanent change in an underlying asthmatic condition, which can persist even after removal from exposure. If an individual\u2019s asthma is worsening at work, it is important to remove the individual from exposure or, at a minimum, reduce exposure and reevaluate his or her condition when it has\n\nstabilized. Although prevention is optimal, medication can substantially modify symptoms and the clinical course of asthma.",
  "Section 43 - 3725 chars": "Occupational asthma can be caused by sensitizers or irritants. Sensitizers are classified as either high molecular weight or low molecular weight. High-molecularweight sensitizers of animal or plant origin include animal dander or grain dust. Low-molecular-weight sensitizers, typically organic or inorganic chemicals, include diisocyanates. Sensitizers generally require a latency period for the development of immunologic responsiveness. This latency period may last from a few weeks to several years after first exposure.29\n\nIn the case of sensitizer-induced asthma (such as toluene diisocyanate or latex), there is a potential for severe exacerbation or fatality upon reexposure.\nAlthough many individuals with occupational asthma improve after removal from exposure to either low-molecular-weight or high-molecularweight sensitizers, more than half fail to recover completely, even after 2 or more years since the last exposure. Those who are sensitized to occupational agents ideally should discontinue further exposure. Both the individual and his or her physician need to monitor the course of asthmatic symptoms, especially if ongoing exposure occurs. Many can be identified as having a particular type of asthma. For those who have allergic asthma, exercise-induced and irritant-induced components may be identified as well.\n\nIrritant-induced asthma, known as reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), may result from a single high-level exposure to a highly irritating gas, fume, mist, or vapor. The diagnosis of RADS requires (1) inhalation exposure to an acutely irritating concentration of a substance, (2) onset of symptoms (cough, wheezing cough, or dyspnea) within 24 hours after exposure with persistent respiratory symptoms, and (3) functional abnormalities (airway hyperresponsiveness) for more than 3 months, with no preexisting respiratory disease.30\n\nIrritant-induced asthma often improves with time; some people may resume their former employment. However, some individuals experience persistent respiratory impairment. Individual assessment is important because reducing the degree and duration of exposure may control symptoms in some people, but complete removal from exposure may be necessary to control symptoms in others.\n\nOccupational and nonoccupational asthma impairment evaluations follow the same guidelines. Both require a thorough review of current occupational and home environments and the likelihood of similar exposures in subsequent workplaces. When assessing impairment due to asthma, information is needed from both clinical and physiologic parameters. The AMA recommends that the examiner follow ATS guidelines when assessing asthma impairment and include measurements of pulmonary mechanics, airway hyperresponsiveness, and medication requirements.1 Table 5-9 lists the criteria for impairment evaluation for asthma severity. The examiner evaluates the indices listed, including the minimum medication needed to control the individual\u2019s asthma.\n\nBefore performing an impairment rating for asthma, the examiner needs to determine that the pattern of asthma is clinically stable and well treated, based upon fulfilling the objectives of treatment as detailed by the expert panel report of the National Asthma Education Program.18,31 The objectives of treatment are: (1) to achieve control or the best overall results (least symptoms, least need for \u00df-adrenergic agonists when taken only if required, best expiratory flow rates, least diurnal variation of flow rates, and least side effects from medication); (2) to use the minimum amount of medication to maintain control or the best overall results; and (3) to treat exacerbations early to prevent them from becoming severe.",
  "Section 44 - 3591 chars": "In 1993, the ATS developed guidelines for the evaluation of impairment and/or disability in individuals with asthma.1 According to the ATS statement, asthma necessitated special guidelines because of its distinct features, including: (1) variable airflow obstruction and change in clinical status over time;\n(2) partial or complete reversibility of airflow obstruction with therapy; (3) nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness to irritants such as dusts, gases, fumes, or smoke; and (4) sensitization to occupational agents producing airway inflammation that with repeated exposure may become chronic and irreversible.\n\nIn assessing an individual with suspected asthma, if the prebronchodilator FEV1 is above the lower limit of normal, use methacholine challenge to assess airway responsiveness. The degree of airway hyperresponsiveness and scoring are illustrated in Table\n\n5-9. If the prebronchodilator FEV1 is below the lower limit of normal, the degree of reversibility is assessed with inhaled bronchodilators (see Table 5-9 for scoring).\n\nTo perform the evaluation at a state of maximal medical improvement, choose the optimal drug treatment to minimize symptoms. The type and extent of necessary medication is one measure of impairment severity (see Table 5-9 for scoring). Use of medication, as a score for impairment, is only used in individuals who have a diagnosis of asthma.\n\nThe scores for postbronchodilator FEV1, reversibility of FEV1 (or PC20), and medication use are added to obtain a summary score for respiratory impairment (see Table 5-10). ATS criteria do not assign impairment percentages. If an impairment percentage is needed, refer to Table 5-10, which assigns impairment classes and percentages to an asthma score. The authors of this chapter have assigned these impairment percentages according to the ATS criteria, based on their clinical judgment. In determining the percent impairment for a particular class, the examiner needs to consider how the person\u2019s asthma affects the ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\n\u2020When FEV1 is greater than the lower limit of normal, PC20 should be determined and used for rating of impairment; when FEV1 is less than 70% of the predicted, the degree of reversibility should be used; and when FEV1 is between 70% of the predicted and the lower limit of normal, either reversibility or PC20 can be used. The score for minimum medication use is added to the appropriate measurement criteria outlined above.\n\n\u2021Need for minimum medication should be demonstrated by the treating physician, for example, through previous records of exacerbation when medications have been reduced. Adapted from ATS guidelines.1\n\n\n5.6 Obstructive Sleep Apnea\nIndividuals with obstructive sleep apnea experience intermittent, repetitive occlusions of the upper airway during sleep, when the pharyngeal muscles are relaxed. These occlusion periods produce airflow cessation at the nose and mouth that leads to progressive hypoxia, which then causes arousal from sleep. The affected person awakens briefly and reestablishes airway patency, resuming airflow with a loud snore or snorting sound. Because of recurrent awakenings during the night, there is disrupted sleep architecture, without restful sleep. Symptoms of sleep apnea include a history of loud snoring, unsatisfactory sleep pattern, daytime somnolence, cognitive dysfunction, and hypertension. Between 60% and 90% are obese and may have a large neck circumference. When the disorder is severe, erythrocytosis, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale may result.",
  "Section 45 - 3136 chars": "Even if total occlusion of the upper airway does not occur during sleep, partial obstruction can lead to significant reduction in airflow and produce obstructive hypopnea, which causes oxyhemoglobin saturation reduction and similar clinical and physiologic abnormalities as seen in obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nA variant of obstructive sleep apnea is the obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The weight of the chest wall in morbidly obese individuals may limit respiratory movements during sleep and wakefulness. As a result, both hypoxia and hypercapnia persist throughout the day as well as during sleep. The same physiologic consequences occur in these individuals as in those with obstructive sleep apnea. In fact, obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome may coexist in the same person.\n\nPeople affected by obstructive sleep apnea are at significantly increased risk of being involved in motor vehicle collisions. Severe daytime somnolence may prevent them from functioning adequately. Subtle changes in neuropsychological function include memory abnormalities and worsened motor coordination and mood that may affect the person\u2019s daily life.\n\nA diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is confirmed by nocturnal polysomnography in an accredited sleep laboratory. Once the diagnosis has been established, prescribe continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) through a nasal device for use during sleep to maintain upper airway patency. Weight loss is the most effective means of long-term management and a possible cure for obstructive sleep apnea if a lower body mass index can be maintained.32\n\nGrading obstructive sleep apnea severity depends on the number of apnea/hypopnea episodes observed in polysomnography and the severity of hypoxia caused by these episodes. There are no standard, welldocumented criteria for determining the level of impairment based on the results of polysomnography. For purposes of impairment rating as discussed in this chapter, refer to the judgment of a sleep specialist.\n\n\n5.7 Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis\n\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis, also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is a granulomatous interstitial and bronchiolar lung disease caused by immune sensitization to organic dusts and some low-molecularweight chemical antigens. A wide variety of antigenic substances are known to cause this disease. The acute disease is characterized by the onset of respiratory and constitutional symptoms beginning\n\n4 to 8 hours after exposure to the offending material. Symptoms include chest tightness, cough, dyspnea, fever, chills, malaise, and myalgias. Pulmonary function tests in the acute phase of the disease show volume restriction and decreased diffusing capacity.\nHypoxia may be demonstrated by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas testing. Chest radiographs may be normal but often show diffuse micronodular changes in the pulmonary parenchyma. When the person is removed from exposure, the symptoms, physiologic changes, and chest radiographic abnormalities begin to resolve within 1 to 2 days, although they may take 4 to 6 weeks for complete resolution.",
  "Section 46 - 3325 chars": "In the subacute and chronic presentations of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the predominant symptoms include exertional dyspnea and cough; some report sputum production, anorexia, fatigue, and weight loss. Pulmonary function studies often show mixed restriction and obstruction with isolated obstructive changes in some individuals. With repeated exposures, pulmonary fibrotic changes may occur as the abnormalities become chronic and irreversible.33\n\nPermanently restrict individuals with hypersensitivity pneumonitis from exposure to the sensitizing agent. If pulmonary fibrosis has not supervened, normal pulmonary function may be reestablished.\nHowever, the onset of pulmonary fibrosis is likely to produce respiratory impairment and may limit other types of employment. Once the acute episode has resolved and the condition is stable, the examiner may rate the degree of permanent impairment according to the criteria given in Table 5-12.\n\nAsthma, pneumoconiosis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis may require that the person refrain from working in a specific occupational setting where he or she is exposed to the offending agent. If reassigned where no ongoing exposure occurs, the individual may not have a permanent respiratory impairment.\n\n\n5.9 Lung Cancer\nAll persons with lung cancer are severely impaired at diagnosis. At reevaluation 1 year after the diagnosis is established, if the person is found to be free of all evidence of tumor recurrence, then he or she is evaluated according to criteria listed in Table 5-12. If there is still evidence of tumor, the he or she is considered to be severely impaired (class 4 impairment); if the tumor recurs, the person will also be considered to be severely impaired (class 4 impairment).\nTable 5-11 (the Karnofsky scale), specifically developed to describe the capabilities of individuals with cancer, may be used to further describe the capabilities of a person with lung cancer and enable categorization within a particular class.\n\n\n5.8 Pneumoconiosis\nPneumoconiosis is a term used to describe diseases resulting from the inhalation of mineral dusts such as silica, coal, and asbestos, and metals such as cobalt and beryllium. The radiologic and pathologic patterns of pneumoconiosis from these dusts are usually quite distinct and beyond the scope of this chapter.\nLatency between exposure to these dusts and development of disease varies, but disease can occur anywhere from 10 up to 30 years after initial exposure.34\n\nThe severity of impairment related to pneumoconiosis depends on the characteristics of the specific dust inhaled, the dust burden retained in the lungs, the susceptibility of the individual, and the length of time since first exposure. Under some circumstances, the parenchymal changes on chest radiograph may be progressive even after removal from exposure and may or may not be associated with physiologic impairment. Persons who develop pneumoconiosis should limit further exposure to the offending agent, particularly if radiographic changes have occurred at a relatively young age or if there is associated physiologic impairment.

Inguinal and femoral hernias typically are painful and entail a greater risk of incarceration or strangulation. Most abdominal wall hernias are amenable to surgical correction.\n\n6.1b Description of Clinical Studies Objective procedures useful in establishing esophageal impairment include, but are not limited to: (1) imaging procedures, such as fluoroscopy and radiography employing contrast media, and computed tomography (CT); (2) peroral endoscopy, including cytologic study or biopsy; and (3) functional tests, such as manometry or intraesophageal pH measurement.\n\nObjective procedures useful in establishing stomach and duodenum impairment include, but are not limited to: (1) imaging techniques, such as fluoroscopy and roentgenography with contrast media, scintigraphy, and CT; (2) peroral endoscopy, with biopsy and cytologic study; (3) gastric secretory tests; (4) malabsorption tests; (5) stool examination; and (6) urea breath test for H. pylori.\n\nObjective procedures useful in establishing impairment of the small intestine include, but are not limited to: (1) fluoroscopy and roentgenography employing contrast media; (2) peroral endoscopy and mucosal biopsy; and (3) intestinal malabsorption testing measures such as fecal fat content and urinary d-xylose excretion tests, carbon 14 breath test, and Schilling test.\n\nObjective procedures useful in establishing impairment of pancreatic function include, but are not limited to: (1) ultrasonography; (2) radiography, including plain or scout films of the abdomen, CT, and endoscopic pancreatography; (3) guided, fineneedle aspiration; (4) determination of plasma glucose level and glucose tolerance; (5) assay of pancreatic enzyme activity in blood, urine, and feces;",

To determine impairment resulting from digestive disorders, desirable weight may be defined as follows:\n\n\n1. If possible, the examiner should determine by history or from previous medical records a weight that predates the individual\u2019s digestive disorder that is considered usual and customary. The examiner should use that weight as the desirable weight from which any deviation is measured.\n\n\n2. If the examiner is not able to determine by history or previous medical records a usual and customary weight that predates the disorder, then the examiner should refer to a table of desirable weights and calculate deviations from the lower end of the table\u2019s range that corresponds to the individual\u2019s gender, height, and body build.\nTables 6-1 and 6-2 present desirable weights according to height for men and women, respectively. For an obese person, the usual preimpairment weight may not be as physiologically desirable as the current weight. Thus, the examiner should use his\nor her clinical judgment when assessing the relative importance of weight loss.\n\n6.1 d Impairment Determination\nImpairment classes, as listed in Tables 6-3 through 6-9, are organand system-specific. The impairment classes and percentage ratings reflect anatomic, physiological, and functional abnormalities at the organ and system level and the ability to perform activities of daily living (see Table 1-2). A gastrointestinal system impairment evaluation falling within\nnormal range reflects an individual who performs all activities of daily living with only normal, occasional gastrointestinal symptoms; no limitation of activities; no special diet; and no required medication, with adequate reserve capacity that allows the body to obtain the required nutrition and maintain normal weight.\n\nFor the purposes of impairment ratings, the upper digestive tract has been defined to include the esophagus, stomach and duodenum, small intestine, and pancreas.

Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.\n\nThe purpose of urinary and reproductive system impairment assessment is to determine whether a permanent impairment in these systems exists, to assess the severity and document the impact of the impairment on the ability to perform activities of daily living, and to prevent further impairment.\n\nPathologic abnormalities in other systems (eg, the hematologic, endocrine, or neurologic systems) may produce urinary or reproductive system impairment. These abnormalities are combined with urinary or reproductive system impairments to produce a whole person impairment rating. For example, an intracranial brain lesion above the pons will produce some degree of bladder hyperreflexia and an urgent need to urinate. However, an intracranial brain lesion below the pons in the spinal cord will result not only in a hyperreflexic bladder but also in detrusorsphincter dyssynergia that may result in difficulty urinating, and high intravesical pressures that could lead to vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis.\nUrinary tract dysfunction is also seen with lumbosacral injury below the T10 vertebra level and would be combined with musculoskeletal dysfunction to determine whole person impairment.\n\nTo determine the individual\u2019s placement within a particular class range, assess the disease\u2019s severity and impact on the ability to perform the activities of daily living as listed in Table 1-2. Impairment ratings are greater for urinary tract or reproductive impairments, which have more of an effect on the ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\n\n7.1 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nSome impairment classes refer to limitations in the ability to perform daily activities because of symptoms. When this information is subjective and possibly misinterpreted, it should not serve as the sole criterion upon which decisions about impairment are made.\nRather, obtain objective data about the limitation\u2019s\n\nextent and integrate the findings with the subjective data to estimate the degree of permanent impairment.\n\n\n7.2  The Urinary System\nThe urinary system consists of the upper urinary tract (the kidneys and ureters), the bladder, and the urethra. The parenchyma of the kidneys produces urine, which is conducted by the renal calices, pelves,",
  "Section 53 - 3204 chars": "and ureters to the bladder and then the urethra.\n\nThe kidneys are an important homeostatic regulatory organ. The degree to which kidney and conduit abnormalities may affect the whole person ranges from a clinically undetectable change to marked specific and generalized manifestations of deterioration of the nephron reserves, loss of kidney function, and urine transport abnormalities.\n\nThe bladder is a voluntarily controllable urine reservoir that normally permits several hours of urine retention. Bladder dysfunction may be due to pathologic conditions within or outside the urinary system. Within the urinary system, bladder tumors, stones, and inflammatory lesions may produce urinary system impairment.\n\nIn women, the urethra is a urinary conduit containing a voluntary sphincter. In men, the urethra possesses a voluntary sphincter and propulsive muscles and is a conduit for urine and seminal ejaculations.\n\nPermanent, surgically created urinary diversions are usually performed to compensate for anatomic losses and to allow for urine outflow. Diversions are evaluated as a part of, and in conjunction with, the assessment of the involved portion of the urinary tract.\nWhen evaluating permanent impairment of any segment of the urinary system, impairments of all components of the upper and lower tract must be evaluated and combined to determine renal system impairment (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).\n\n\n7.2 a Interpretation of Urinary Symptoms and Signs\nSymptoms and signs of upper urinary tract function impairment may include changes in urination; edema; decreased physical stamina; appetite and weight loss; anemia; uremia; loin, abdominal, or costovertebral angle pain; hematuria; chills and fever; hypertension and its complications; abnormalities in the appearance of the urine or its\n\nsediment; and biochemical blood changes. Renal disease, especially in early stages, may be made evident only by laboratory findings.\n\nSigns and symptoms of bladder function impairment may include urinary frequency, dysuria, urinary incontinence, urine retention, hematuria, pyuria, passage of urinary calculi, and a suprapubic mass.\n\nSigns and symptoms of urethra function impairment include dysuria, diminished urinary stream, urinary retention, incontinence, extraneous or ectopic urinary openings, periurethral masses, and diminished urethral caliber.\n\n\n7.2 b Description of Clinical Studies\nTwo clinically useful renal function determinations, serum creatinine and the renal clearance of endogenous creatinine, may serve as criteria for evaluating upper urinary tract function. The serum creatinine level reflects overall renal function. Under normal hydration conditions, the serum creatinine level should be less than 133 \u00b5mol/L (1.5 mg/dL).\n\nThe glomerular filtration rate, which measures renal clearance of endogenous creatinine, gives a quantitative estimate of the total functioning nephron population. Because longer periods of urine collection improve the reliability of renal function clearance tests, use 24-hour endogenous creatinine clearance measurements. The normal creatinine clearance ranges are 130 to 200 L/24 h (90 to 139 mL/min) for men and 115 to",
  "Section 54 - 3002 chars": "180 L/24 h (80 to 125 mL/min) for women.\n\nIf there are discrepancies in these two test results or additional information is needed, tests\u2014such as metabolic studies, tests of the concentration levels of electrolytes and other chemicals in serum and urine, urine osmolalities, urinalyses, urine cultures, radiologic investigations, isotope renograms, and renal computed tomographic (CT) scans\u2014may be necessary to determine impairment.\n\nParenchymal disfiguration and conduit abnormality assessment may require diagnostic procedures such as endoscopy, study of one or both kidneys, biopsy, arteriography, radiography of the urinary tract, CAT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nObjective techniques useful in evaluating bladder function include (but are not limited to) cystoscopy, cystography, voiding cystourethrography, cystometry, uroflometry, urinalysis, and urine cultures.\n\nObjective techniques useful in evaluating urethral function include (but are not limited to) urethroscopy, urethrography, cystourethrography, endoscopy, and cystometrography.\n\n\n7.3  Upper Urinary Tract\n\n\n7.3 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Upper Urinary Tract Disease\nThe impairment criteria for evaluating upper urinary tract disease are given in Table 7-1. The creatinine clearance, the most accurate reflection of renal function, is an important criterion in each class because it quantifies the degree of upper urinary tract functional impairment.\n\nFrom a physiologic point of view, the individual with only one functioning kidney may have normal overall renal function because of the efficiency of the remaining kidney. However, with only one kidney, a normal safety factor is lost. Consider the individual with only one functioning kidney as having a 10% whole person impairment because of such an essential organ loss. Combine this percentage with the estimate for any other permanent impairment (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).\n\nRenal function deterioration that requires either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis indicates severe impairment in the 60% to 95% range, or a class 4 impairment (Table 7-1). Successful renal transplantation may result in marked renal function improvement; the impairment is now in the 15% to 34% range, or a class 2 impairment. However,\ntransplant recipients require continuous observation and medication, which may add to their impairment. For this reason, depending upon the impairment\u2019s effect on the activities of daily living (see Table 1-2), one may add 0% to 5% to the final renal function impairment estimate, as discussed in Chapter 1.1\n\nAlso, evaluate impairment that is related to complications of the disease or therapy, such as cushingoid changes and osteoporosis, as they arise, and combine the appropriate percentages with the final renal impairment estimate (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).\n\nImpairment Rating: 0% impairment of the whole person.\nComment: Full recovery with no permanent impairment.",

See the following sections for impairment percentages for male reproductive organs for 40to 65-year-old men. Increase the percentages by 50% for men younger than 40, and decrease the percentages by 50% for men older than\n\n65. For instance, class 3 impairment in a 35-year-old man would be rated at 30% (20% + 0.5[20%]). New treatments, when successful, may decrease the degree of impairment.\n\n\n7.7 a Penis\nThe penis has the sexual functions of erection and ejaculation. The penis\u2019s urinary function is discussed in the first part of this chapter on the urethra (Section 7.6). Penile functional impairment symptoms and signs include erection and sensation abnormalities and partial or complete loss of the penis.\n\nWhen evaluating penis impairment, consider both sexual and urinary function impairment. Determine sexual function impairment according to the following classifications. To determine impairment of the whole person, combine this estimate with the appropriate percentage for estimated urinary function impairment. This classification also may be used to estimate penile implant use impairment (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).\n\nObjective techniques useful in evaluating penis function include (but are not limited to) penile tumescence studies, Doppler ultrasound penile blood flow evaluations, dynamic cavernosometry and cavernosography, and angiography.10-14\n\n\n7.7b Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Penile Disease\nThe impairment criteria for evaluating penile disease are given in Table 7-5.\n\n\n7.7c Scrotum\nThe scrotum covers, protects, and provides a suitable environment for the testicles.

Permanent impairment of the skin is any dermatologic abnormality or loss that persists after medical treatment and rehabilitation and that is unlikely to change significantly in the next year, with or without medical treatment.\n\nTable 8-1 summarizes skin components, functions, and disorders. Skin functions include: (1) providing a protective covering; (2) participating in sensory perception, temperature regulation, fluid regulation, electrolyte balance, immunobiologic defenses, and trauma resistance; and (3) regenerating the epidermis and its appendages.\n\nProtective skin functions include barrier defenses against chemical irritant and allergic sensitizer damage, microorganism invasion, and ultraviolet light injuries. Temperature regulation involves proper sweat gland and small blood vessel functioning. The barrier defense against fluid loss is related to the intactness of the stratum corneum.\n\nRevisions from the fourth edition include: (1) new sections on contact dermatitis and natural rubber latex allergy; (2) a new section on cancer; and (3) updated clinical information and references.\n\n\n8.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.\n\nSkin disorders may develop from exposure to physical, mechanical, biological, and chemical agents.\nIdentification and avoidance of these agents may prevent ongoing skin disorder aggravation. Physicians need to determine the clinical course and permanence\n\nof skin disorders associated with possible intermittent exposures.\n\nClinical evaluation requires sound clinical judgment based on a detailed medical history, thorough physical examination, and judicious use of diagnostic procedures. Ancillary diagnostic and laboratory procedures include patch, open, prick, intracutaneous, and serologic allergy tests; Wood\u2019s light examinations, cultures, and scrapings for bacteria, fungi, and viruses; and biopsies.",
  "Section 58 - 3005 chars": "To determine the appropriate impairment class (Table 8-2) for an affected individual, evaluate the severity of the skin condition and the impact of the skin condition on the ability to perform activities of daily living (see Table 1-2). Determine the appropriate percentage within any impairment class by considering the frequency, intensity, and complexity of the medical condition and the treatment regimen. In general, the more frequent and intense the symptoms, signs, and medical treatment, the higher the estimated impairment rating within any impairment class. Table 8-2 lists the impairment classes and percents of whole person impairment for all dermatologic disorders. A brief overview of those disorders follows.\n\nImpairments of other body systems, such as behavioral problems, restriction of motion or ankylosis of joints, and respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, or gastrointestinal tract disorders, may be associated\n\nwith skin impairments. When there is a permanent impairment of more than one body system, evaluate the extent of whole person impairment related to each system and combine the estimated impairment percentages (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine total impairment.\n\n\n8.1a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nIn some cases, limitations in the ability to perform daily activities are based on symptoms. This information may be subjective and possibly misinterpreted, and it should not serve as the sole criterion for impairment rating decisions. Rather, obtain objective data about the extent of the limitation and integrate findings with subjective data to estimate the permanent impairment rating.\n\n\n8.1a.1 Pruritus\nPruritus is a common symptom of dermatologic conditions. Pruritus is a subjective, unpleasant sensation and symptom that provokes the desire to scratch and rub the skin. The itching sensation may be intolerable. Pruritus is closely related to pain and is mediated by pain receptors and fibers when they are weakly stimulated. Like pain, pruritus may be defined as a unique complex of afferent stimuli that interacts with the individual\u2019s emotional or affective state of mind.\n\nThe pruritus sensation has two elements that are extremely variable in makeup and time. Peripheral neural stimulation varies from the absence of sensation to awareness that stimuli are producing a usual or unusual sensation. Central nervous system reaction is modified by state of attentiveness, experience, motivation at the moment, and such stimuli as exercise, sweat, and temperature change.\n\nWhen evaluating pruritus associated with skin disorders, consider (1) how the pruritus interferes with performance of the activities of daily living, and (2) to what extent the pruritus description is supported by such objective skin signs as lichenification, excoriation, or hyperpigmentation. Subjective itching complaints that cannot be substantiated objectively may require referral or consultation.\n\n\n8.1b Description of Procedures",
  "Section 59 - 3211 chars": "Common clinical investigations for dermatologic conditions include skin testing, biopsy, and relevant laboratory studies.\n\n8.1\nb.1 Patch Testing, Performance, Interpretation, and Relevance\nThe sine qua non for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis is a properly performed and interpreted patch test. The information from patch testing complements an appropriate, detailed history. Patch testing may significantly contribute to the diagnosis and management of contact dermatitis.\n\nBe aware that patch testing may yield false-positive and false-negative results. Selecting the proper concentration of the suspected allergen, vehicle, site of application, and type of patch is critical for procedure validity. Making such selections and determining test result relevance require considerable skill and experience.\n\nInterpret a positive or negative patch test result in conjunction with the clinical history and a detailed knowledge of testing procedures. Although appropriate test concentrations and vehicles have been established for many sensitizers, there are no established vehicle and concentration standards for the vast number of chemicals in use.\n\nPatch test results require careful interpretation to discern allergic from irritant responses, as well as to appropriately interpret whether the result is relevant to the individual\u2019s dermatitis and exposures. Patch tests are only used to detect contact allergy and are only one component in a complete evaluation.\nFurther details about patch testing, its values, and its limitations are discussed in standard texts, some of which are listed at the end of this chapter.\n\n\n8.2  Disfigurement\nSkin disfigurement is an altered or abnormal appearance that may be an alteration of color, shape, or structure, or a combination of these.\nDisfigurement may be a residual of injury or disease, or it may accompany a recurrent or ongoing disorder. Examples of disfigurement include giant pigmented nevi, nevus flammeus, cavernous hemangioma, and pigmentation alteration.\n\nDisfigurement usually has no effect on body function and may have little or no effect on the ability to perform activities of daily living, except if the disfigurement causes social rejection or an unfavorable\nself-image with self-imposed isolation, lifestyle alteration, or other behavioral changes. If impairment in the ability to perform activities of daily living due\n\nto disfigurement does exist, it is usually manifested by a behavior change, such as withdrawal from social contacts. Behavioral changes are evaluated in accordance with the criteria in the Guides Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders.\n\nEvaluate impairments related to disfigurement or altered pigmentation in accordance with the criteria given in Table 8-2 and described later in this chapter. Enhance disfigurement descriptions with good color photographs that show multiple defect views.\nEstimate the probable duration and permanency of the disfigurement. Describe in writing the possibility of improving the condition through medical or surgical therapy and the extent to which it can be concealed cosmetically, as with hairpieces, wigs, or cosmetics. Depict with photographs if possible.",
  "Section 60 - 3083 chars": "Evaluate the effect on the performance of the activities of daily living if a scar involves the loss of sweat gland function, hair growth, nail growth, or pigment formation. Evaluate burns and scars according to the criteria in this chapter; give special consideration to the injury\u2019s impact on the individual\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living. When impairment resulting from a burn or scar is based on peripheral nerve dysfunction or loss of range of motion, evaluate the skin impairment separately and combine the impairment rating with that from Chapters 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System; 16, The Upper Extremities; or 17, The Lower Extremities. If chest wall excursion is limited or if there are behavioral changes secondary to disfigurement, consult Chapter 5, The Respiratory System, or Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders.\n\n\n8.3  Scars and Skin Grafts\nScars, cutaneous abnormalities that result from the healing of burned, traumatized, or diseased tissue, represent a special type of disfigurement. Give the scars\u2019 dimensions in centimeters, and describe their shape, color, anatomic location, and any evidence of ulceration, depression, or elevation. Indicate whether the scar is \u201catrophic\u201d or \u201chypertrophic\u201d; soft and pliable or hard and indurated, thin or thick, and smooth or rough; and attachment, if any, to underlying bones, joints, muscles, or other tissue. Good color photographs with multiple views of the defect enhance the scars\u2019 description.\n\nConsider the tendency of a scar to disfigure when evaluating whether there is permanent impairment due to scarring. Also consider whether the scar can be changed, made less visible, or concealed.\nFunction may be restored without improving appearance, and appearance may be improved without altering function.\n\nSkin grafts may be used to replace skin losses resulting from trauma or disease. Grafts commonly lack hair, lubrication, pliability, and sensation, and they may demonstrate altered pigmentation. These changes affect the function and appearance of the graft site. The altered lubrication, pliability, and sensation may result in diminished protection against microorganisms and diminished resistance to mechanical, chemical, and thermal trauma. The altered appearance may be significant if the area involves exposed parts, such as the dorsum of the hand, the face, or the neck.\n\n8.4\n\ntact Dermatitis\nContact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin reaction induced by exposure to an external agent and is the most frequent cause of occupational skin disease.\nContact dermatitis most often involves the hands, wrists, and forearms, although any area may be affected. Two types of contact dermatitis are generally recognized: irritant (80% of cases), which results from direct tissue damage, and allergic (20% of cases), in which tissue damage is mediated through type IV delayed cellular hypersensitivity.\nIrritant and allergic contact dermatitis may coexist in the same person and are often difficult to differentiate on physical examination and histologically.",
  "Section 61 - 3295 chars": "Irritants may be strong (absolute) or weak (marginal). Cumulative exposure to marginal irritants causes most cases of contact dermatitis and may impair the barrier function of the skin, allowing the penetration of potential allergens. Many cutaneous allergens, such as chromates, nickel salts, epoxy resins, and preservatives, are also primary irritants. Allergy can be induced or maintained by chemicals in concentrations insufficient to irritate nonallergic skin. Allergen cross-sensitivity is an important phenomenon in which an individual who is allergic to one chemical (eg, urushiol in poison ivy or poison oak) also will react to structurally related chemicals (eg, in Japanese lacquer, mango, and cashew nutshell oil).\n\nAccurate diagnosis is the key to proper management of contact dermatitis. If the specific agent(s) can be identified (see section on patch testing) and successfully avoided, full recovery usually is anticipated; but if contact continues, the dermatitis may become chronic and disabling, and it may prevent the individual from performing some activities of daily living.\n\n\n8.5 Natural Rubber Latex Allergy\nLatex allergy generally refers to an IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reaction to one or more protein allergens present in natural rubber latex (NRL) devices, especially gloves. Individuals with spina bifida and health care workers are at particular risk; NRL allergy has become a significant medical and occupational health problem. Clinical manifestations range from contact urticaria and angioedema to allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis. Contact dermatitis to rubber accelerators and antioxidants added during manufacture has been associated with NRL allergy. A number of NRLallergic individuals are atopic, with asthma, other environmental type I allergies, and hand eczema.\nSymptoms and signs of contact urticaria to NRL may be masked by preexisting hand eczema. Also evaluate individuals with NRL allergy for manifestions in other organ systems (eg, respiratory symptoms and asthma). See Chapter 5, The Respiratory System, for an example of NRL-induced asthma.\n\nAllergen avoidance is the current treatment for NRL allergy. When aerosolized, glove powder (an NRLallergen carrier) can produce respiratory symptoms in susceptible individuals. Affected workers may have to avoid contact with NRL gloves and other NRL-containing products, avoid areas where they might inhale the powder from NRL gloves worn by other workers, and wear a medical alert bracelet.\n\n8.6\n\nn Cancer\nSkin cancer is the most prevalent of all cancers. Three main types exist: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma.\n\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer. Predisposing factors include light skin color, inability to tan, sun exposure, blond or red hair, freckling in childhood, therapeutic radiation, and arsenic exposure. Several different clinical and histologic types exist; there is also a much less common, inherited condition called the basal cell nevus or Gorlin syndrome. BCC is usually locally invasive, with a small metastatic potential. The main goal of therapy is complete eradication of the tumor with the highest cure rate and the least amount of disfigurement.",
  "Section 62 - 3581 chars": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) makes up about one fifth of nonmelanoma skin cancers. SCC is more common in individuals with light skin coloration and can arise from excess sun exposure, leading to precancerous actinic keratoses. Environmental risk factors include arsenic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, chronic infrared heat, and therapeutic radiation exposure. SCC may also occur in chronic scars from burns, trauma, and inflammatory processes.\nSeveral clinical and histologic types exist, but SCC is more likely to metastasize, especially from sites involving the lip, dorsal hand, and temple, as well\nas in larger, deeper, and more anaplastic lesions. Therapeutic options are the same as for basal cell carcinoma. Sun avoidance and close follow-up are essential in patients with SCC.\n\nCutaneous malignant melanoma is an increasingly common and lethal malignancy of melanocytes and nevus cells in certain precursor lesions. The increased frequency of melanoma is well documented; rates of incidence are rising more rapidly for this than for any other cancer. The salient challenge for clinicians is to detect and excise melanoma in its earliest stage, as tumor thickness remains the most important prognostic indicator of this malignancy.\nEarly diagnosis and surgical excision of in situ, or early invasive, melanomas are curative in most individuals. Despite advances in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the efficacy of treatment of advanced melanoma remains limited, and the prognosis of metastatic disease remains guarded.\n\n\n8.7 Criteria for Rating Permanent\nImpairment Due to Skin Disorders\nThe impairment criteria for all dermatologic disorders are given in Table 8-2.\n\nCurrent Symptoms: None.\nPhysical Exam: Hands and arms: no signs of dermatitis.\nClinical Studies: Patch test: strong allergic reaction to 0.1% petrolatum mixture of a nonmercurial preservative, 2-n-4-isothiazolin-3-one, used in company\u2019s latex paints. Subsequent evaluation: normal.\nDiagnosis: Resolved allergic contact dermatitis caused by preservative.\n\n\n8.8 Skin Impairment Evalution Summary\nSee Table 8-3 for an evalution summary for the assessment of permanent impairment due to skin disorders.\n\nChapter 9:\n9.1 Principles of Assessment\n9.2 Anemia\n9.3 Polycythemia and Myelofibrosis\n9.4 White Blood Cell Diseases or Abnormalities\n9.5 Hemorrhagic and Platelet Disorders\n9.6 Thrombotic Disorders\n9.7 Hematologic Impairment Evaluation Summary\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides criteria for evaluating permanent impairment of the hematopoietic system. The hematopoietic system, including the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, produces a heterogeneous population of blood-circulating cells (eg, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) and a complex family of proteins critical for blood clotting and immune defenses. Cells from this system also produce proteins that affect daily physiologic responses (eg, granulocyte, granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factors, etc) and respond to many pathologic stimuli (eg, tumor necrosis factor and interleukins). Because the hematopoietic system supports other cells or organs of the body, identifiable defects are assigned impairment ratings only secondarily through altered function of other end organs. For example, very severe anemia can reduce oxygen delivery to the point where the individual suffers a myocardial infarction or stroke. Age and comorbid conditions further complicate the determination of impairment. Most of the products of the hematopoietic system also include remarkable compensatory biologic mechanisms.",
  "Section 63 - 3393 chars": "191\nClinical alterations can be hereditary or acquired. Because of functional adaptation of the young, hereditary defects manifest in childhood are commonly modest in degree of impairment. With age, alterations become more definitive and functional impairment more evident. Abnormalities can be quantitative\u2014production of too many cells (ie, leukemia or polycythemia) or too few cells (ie, anemia or thrombocytopenia)\u2014or they can be qualitative, with production of a defective protein (ie, factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210A) resulting in an increased propensity for thrombosis.\nThis edition of the Guides has expanded sections on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and thrombotic disorders.\n9.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.\n9.1 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs Some impairment classes refer to symptoms that limit the ability to perform daily activities. When this information is subjective and open to misinterpretation, it should not serve as the sole criterion upon which decisions about impairment are made. Rather, the examiner should obtain objective data about the limitations\u2019 extent and integrate those findings with the subjective data to estimate the degree of permanent impairment.\nImpairment percentages reflect severity of symptoms, physical and laboratory findings, and estimated functional limitations resulting from hematologic abnormality. See Table 9-1 for the functional classifications of hematologic system disease. The activities of daily living are listed in Table 1-2 and the Glossary.\n9.1 b Description of Procedures\nAids to diagnose hematologic impairment vary depending on the suspected diagnosis. Common tests include a complete blood count, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, hemoglobin electrophoresis, direct and indirect antiglobulin test and cold agglutinin assay, flow cytometry, cytogenetics of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow, immunochemical analysis of immunoglobulins, fat pad biopsy with Congo red stain, and hemostasis studies.\n9.2  Anemia\nThe functional effects of chronic anemia depend on the degree of the cardiovascular system\u2019s compensatory response. Regardless of the anemia\u2019s pathogenesis, impairment is related to the heart\u2019s inability to deliver adequate oxygen to tissues. To compensate for the anemia, the heart increases cardiac output by acceleration of heart rate and also increases oxygen extraction from the tissues (ie, increases arteriovenous difference). Therefore, a person with a mild anemia (hemoglobin level of about 10 g/dL) and a normal cardiovascular system receives a lower impairment rating than a person with underlying dysfunction of the cardiovascular system.\nSymptoms of anemia include shortness of breath on exertion, dizziness, throbbing headaches, and fatigue. The speed at which anemia develops at any hemoglobin level correlates to the complexity of symptoms. Greater degrees of anemia may be associated with lack of stamina, fatigue on exertion, fatigue at rest, and dyspnea at rest. Thus, no specific concentrations of hemoglobin determine impairment.",
  "Section 64 - 3186 chars": "Anemia impairment is measured by the limitations of\nThe Hematopoietic System\n193\ncardiovascular response and may be lessened by a successful blood transfusion.\nMany forms of anemia are reversible with specific therapy. Anemias resulting from decreased red cell production due to nutrient deficit (eg, iron-deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia secondary to folic acid,\nof impairment is related to the anemia\u2019s severity, need for transfusion, and impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living. Additional organ system impairment due to anemia can be combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\nThe benefits of red blood cell transfusion normally\nvitamin B\ndeficiency, etc) are correctable with spe-\nlast 6 to 8 weeks. In individuals with hemolytic ane-\ncific nutrient therapy.\nA permanent impairment may develop from sequelae of the anemia. In megaloblastic anemia due to B deficiency, significant neurologic deficit caused by dysmyelinization (particularly of the posterolateral spinal tracks) may occur and result in permanent neurologic impairment. Folic acid deficiency during pregnancy may result in lifelong impairment of the newborn with varying degrees of neural tube defects. In some circumstances of hypoproliferative anemia from chronic renal failure, the anemia is correctable with exogenous erythropoietin even though the renal failure is irreversible. Similarly, many forms of anemia due to increased and, particularly, acquired red cell destruction (ie, hemolytic anemias) are reversible with therapy and therefore do not result in permanent impairment.\nPersistent hemolytic anemia may cause a degree of impairment that is related to the anemia\u2019s severity. This impairment consideration also applies to aplastic or refractory anemia caused by defective bone marrow function. Persistent refractory anemia may cause impairment regardless of the cause; the degree\nmia caused by serum factors, and in some who have had many transfusions, the survival rate of transfused cells is shortened and transfusions must be repeated every 1 to 5 weeks. Impairment increases as hemolysis becomes more severe.\nIn congenital hemolytic anemias, particularly those related to altered hemoglobin synthesis (eg, hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias), tissue impairment beyond the hematopoietic system results in permanent impairment.1 Sickle cell diseases, especially sickle cell anemia, are commonly associated with severe, painful vaso-occlusive crisis that can result in functional impairment of varying degrees.2 These vascular occlusive lesions result in end-organ damage to the bones, heart, kidneys, and liver, compounding the degree of impairment.\n9.2 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Anemia\nThe impairment criteria for anemia are given in Table 9-2.\n\u2020Implies hemolysis of transfused blood.\nPolycythemia can produce end-organ damage to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular areas due to vascular occlusion. Vascular obstruction of the postal venous system similarly can produce end-organ injury to the liver. The impairment rating is based on the end organ involved, degree of injury, and impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living.",
  "Section 65 - 3251 chars": "The Hematopoietic System\n197\nThe criteria for diagnosis of myelofibrosis, of primary (idiopathic) or secondary (postpolycythemic) etiology, include progressive anemia with red cell changes of anisocytosis and poikilocytosis, a shift to the left of the granulocytic white cell series, and, often, nucleated red blood cells in the peripheral blood. Bone marrow indicates fibrosis with dilated sinusoids and clustering of megakaryocytes. The degree of impairment due to myelofibrosis is reflected by the degree of impairment due to the anemia. Examples are provided in the impairment section on anemia (also see Table 9-2).\nTwo types of leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and chronic granulocytic leukemia, result in impaired function of the individual and limited life expectancy, even with currently available therapy. Impairment is based on symptoms, physical findings, requirement for and frequency of therapy, and the ability to carry out activities of daily living.\n9.4 b Lymphocytes\nLymphocytes provide humoral and cellular defense mechanisms. Circulating lymphocytes originate in lymphoid tissues: the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus. Lymphocytes circulate between the blood and the tissues. Lymphocyte cells have heterogeneous functions.\nOf the two major subgroups, the \u201cT,\u201d or thymusderived, lymphocytes are primarily responsible for cellular immunity and are involved in delayed hypersensitivity reactions and transplant rejection. The \u201cB,\u201d or bursa-derived, lymphocytes are primarily responsible for humoral immunity related to the production of immunoglobulins and biologically active kinins. Subtypes of both T and B lymphoctyes have distinct functions and abnormalities that produce distinct clinical syndromes.\nLymphocytes can be abnormal in function and/or number, often leading to recurrent infections.\nIndividuals with Hodgkin\u2019s disease or connective tissue diseases and those who have been exposed to ionizing radiation all have acquired functional defects. Some \u201cautoimmune\u201d diseases may be a result of functionally altered or numerically predominant subsets of lymphocytes. Impairment ratings due to abnormal numbers of lymphocytes, as with lymphopenia, are based on the severity of the condition, as indicated by recurrent infection, and a limited ability to perform activities of daily living.\nThe best documentation of defective lymphocyte function or numbers is to determine failure of end functions like generalized immunoglobulin deficiency or delayed hypersensitivity reaction failure. Lymphocyte abnormalities are associated with three forms of neoplastic transformation: (1) leukemias (including chronic lymphatic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphatic leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia)4; (2) lymphomas (including Hodgkin\u2019s disease, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and mycosis fungoides); and (3) multiple myeloma and macroglobulinemia.\nChronic lymphatic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and some low-grade lymphomas may be relatively indolent, require no initial therapy unless severe and irreversible, and constitute no impairment for several years. Similarly, multiple myeloma and macroglo bulinemia may be asymptomatic initially, manifested only by certain laboratory abnormalities, and consti-",
  "Section 66 - 3190 chars": "tute no impairment. However, some individuals have a high level of impairment because of recurrent GI tract bleeding. Impairment may be related to developing anemia, the need for chemotherapy or radiation to enlarging lymph nodes, or, in the case of multiple myeloma, bone pain. See Chapters 6, The Digestive System; 16, The Upper Extremities; 17, The Lower Extremities; and 18, Pain, for more information about intestinal bleeding and bone pain.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection creates a progressive and ultimately fatal disease process with a complex course and widely variable degrees of functional impairment. HIV can directly destroy CD4T lymphocytes, resulting in impairment of the normal immune response against infection and neoplastic processes. The risk of developing opportunistic infection is, in general, inversely related to the absolute CD4 count.5, 6\nHIV infection impairment is caused by singleor multiple-organ system involvement from primary HIV infection or the opportunistic infection or neoplastic process from immunologic dysfunction.\nEssentially, every organ system can be affected, including hematologic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurologic, dermatologic, and renal. Several systems are often simultaneously affected, adding to the complexity of impairment determination.\nAcute retroviral syndrome may develop early in HIV infection; symptoms include fever, fatigue, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia. Quantitative HIV RNA measurements also indicate the extent of\nHIV infection. Early stages are characterized by a CD4 count greater than 0.50 ? 109/L (500 cells/mm3); individuals are often asymptomatic but may have lymphadenopathy, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and dermatologic conditions. Intermediate stages have CD4 counts of 0.20 ? 109/L to 0.50 ? 109/L (200-500 cells/mm3); antiretroviral therapy is often initiated to prolong this stage of disease. Individuals may have few or no symptoms or may develop constitutional symptoms, diarrhea, herpes simplex infection, oral or vaginal candidiasis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, or common bacterial infection. Advanced stages, often defined by CD4 counts less than 0.20 ? 109/L (200 cells/mm3), are associated\nwith an increased incidence of opportunistic infection\nThe Hematopoietic System\n199\nand meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). At low CD4 level, there is increased incidence of complications, including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP); Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis; tuberculosis; cryptosporidiosis salmonellosis; esophageal candidiasis; neoplasms including Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, lymphoma, and cervical cancer; and neurologic dysfunction, such as mononeuritis multiplex, peripheral neuropathies, cranial nerve palsies, and myelitis. At CD4 levels below\n0.10 ? 109/L (100 cells mm3), the following are more common: HIV-associated dementia, wasting syndromes, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), cryptococcal meningitis, disseminated coccidiomycosis, histoplasmosis, and invasive aspergillosis.",
  "Section 67 - 3371 chars": "The degree of symptomatic involvement and the course of illness in individuals with the same CD4 cell-defined stages varies significantly. Functional impairment can also develop from toxicity responses to antiretroviral treatments, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors; viral protease enzyme inhibitors; and antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antineoplastic therapy. Determine total impairment only after careful assessment of each of the potentially affected organ systems. Also consider the nature and severity of the primary or secondary infections or neoplastic processes. If several organ systems are involved in the HIV infection process, the whole person impairment percentages related to the involved systems are combined using the Combined Values Chart (see p. 604).\n9.4 c Monocytes-Macrophages\nThe monocyte-macrophage family ingests foreign proteins, removes cellular debris, particulates material, and modulates immune responses. This functional unit of circulating monocytes and fixed macrophages, \u201chistiocytes,\u201d is structurally associated with endothelial cells and fibroblasts in the reticuloendothelial system. This system is recognized primarily by the phagocytic capacity of monocytes and macrophages.\nKnowledge about functional defects in the monocyte-macrophage system is limited. The degree of impairment can be associated with the nature, type, and extent of infection. Lipid storage disease is another abnormality in which macrophages become repositories for lipids, and cellular and organ hyperplasia occurs in the spleen, lymph nodes, and\nbone marrow. Marrow involvement can produce progressive and massive bone abnormalities and fractures; impairment focuses on the degree of orthopedic deficit.\nNeurologic involvement also occurs in some severe forms of lipid storage disease. Enzyme replacement therapy is now available for Gaucher disease, one of the most common types of lipid storage disease.\nThis therapy is incredibly effective at reversing most abnormalities except for neurologic deficit. Impairment depends on the nature of the lipid, rate of deposition, and primarily affected organs.\nNeoplastic transformation occurs primarily as acute monocytic leukemia, a relatively rare form of leukemia. Leukemic reticuloendotheliosis is a more chronic variant. The exact cell of origin is not clear, but the condition behaves as a form of chronic neoplastic transformation.\n9.4d The Spleen and Splenectomy\nA normal spleen cleanses the blood of bacteria and other foreign matter. Splenectomy removes a quarter of the total lymphoid tissue and the major mass of macrophages. As a consequence of splenectomy, some functional abnormalities may develop. These include impaired clearance of certain encapsulated bacteria, such as the pneumococcus. Occasionally, individuals develop overwhelming infections after splenectomy. This occurs in fewer than 2% of people from whom the organ has been removed and is confined mostly to the first 2 years after the operation. The incidence is greatly reduced by prophylactic administration of the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. Splenectomy leads to some subtle, albeit clinically silent, morphologic abnormalities of red blood cells and a slight elevation of the platelet count. Splenectomized individuals are not at an increased risk for viral or other infections from nonencapsulated bacteria.",

Hyperhomocysteinemia can be controlled with high doses of folates; arterial thrombosis is treated according to the system involved.\nThrombotic disorder impairment results from systematic complications following thrombosis and anticoagulation regimen. It depends on the type, site, and extent of the organ involvement, as well as the response and complications of anticoagulation.\nArterial thrombi may produce ischemic heart disease, stroke, or intermittent claudication. Venous thrombosis usually resolves with no aftereffects. If unresolved, postthrombosis syndrome may develop due to vein lumen narrowing and/or venous valve insufficiency, causing lower extremity edema, venous ulceration, venous thrombosis recurrence, and ambulation limitation.\n9.6c Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Thrombotic Disorders Impairment is evaluated according to the affected body system. The impairment rating for a thrombotic disorder is based upon the degree of injury to the end organ, such as the lungs, heart, brain, kidney, extremities, etc, and upon how the disorder affects the individual\u2019s capacity to perform activities of daily living. For example, a thrombotic disorder causing a stroke would be rated based on the effects of the stroke, as outlined in the nervous system. Long-term anticoagulation with warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin increases bleeding risk and constitutes impairment in the 10% range. If there is an impairment rating of several organ systems, whole person impairment ratings for each affected system are combined (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).\n\nChapter 10:\nThe Endocrine System\n10.1 Principles of Assessment\n10.2 Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis\n10.3 Thyroid\n10.4 Parathyroids\n10.5 Adrenal Cortex\n10.6 Adrenal Medulla\n10.7 Pancreas (Islets of Langerhans)\n10.8 Gonads\n10.9 Mammary Glands\n10.10 Metabolic Bone Disease\n10.11 Endocrine System Impairment Evaluation Summary\n\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides criteria for evaluating permanent impairment of the endocrine system. The endocrine system is composed of the hypothalmicpituitary complex, thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, islet cell tissue of the pancreas, and gonads. These ductless glands secrete hormones that regulate the activity of organs or tissues of the body. These hormones control growth, bone structure, sexual development and function, metabolism, and electrolyte balance. The various endocrine glands are usually interdependent, and a disorder of one gland may be reflected by dysfunction in one or more of the other endocrine glands, which, in turn, may affect other body systems. Consider multiple system effects when an endocrine permanent impairment is identified.",
  "Section 69 - 3037 chars": "The following revisions have been made for the fifth edition: (1) the descriptions of endocrine gland function and of disease states have been updated, as well as the techniques for evaluation of these diseases;\n(2) the nomenclature of test procedures and of disease entities, such as diabetes mellitus, has been updated; and (3) although the criteria for percentage of impairment have remained the same, many more examples of impairment have been included.\n\n10.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods of performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluations.\n\nDysfunction of an endocrine organ may be the result of an injury to the gland or of disease involving atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, or neoplasia. An endocrine impairment develops from altered hormone secretion by one or more endocrine glands and the effect of such hormonal aberration on nonendocrine tissue. An impairment rating reflects the severity of the medical condition, the need for medication, and the effects of the impairment on the individual\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\nWhen an endocrine disorder results in decreased secretion of a hormone, it is usually possible to replace the hormone by either the oral or the parenteral route, resulting in virtual normalization of body physiology except, of course, for the inability to secrete the hormone. Apart from the need to take the medication on an ongoing basis, decreased secretion alone does not warrant an impairment rating. In cases where the replacement hormone does not completely mimic physiologic hormone secretion, however, the individual may be given an impairment rating to reflect the change in terms of either normal activity or ability to respond to stress.\n\nEndocrine deficiencies may cause or be associated with impairments of other organ systems. Impairment ratings in other body systems are evaluated separately and then combined with the impairment rating from this chapter, using the Combined Values Chart\n(p. 604) to determine the estimated whole person impairment.\n\nDisorders resulting in increased secretion of a hormone often can be effectively treated. In some cases, treatment may leave the individual with a reduced ability to secrete the hormone. If so, the severity of the resulting condition and the effect on the ability to perform activities of daily living are evaluated to determine the impairment rating.\n\nAs stated in Chapter 2, even with appropriate medication, it is debatable whether the individual has regained the previous status of good health. Thus, the examiner may increase the impairment rating by a small percentage (1% to 3%) to account for an incomplete return to a condition of normal health.\n\n\n10.1 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs",

The hypothalamus produces chemical factors that either inhibit or enhance production of anterior pituitary hormones. The hypothalamus also produces precursors (prohormones) of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin, which travel through neural axons and are stored in the posterior pituitary.\n\nThe anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, with modulation by the hypothalamus, produces trophic hormones that control the activity of the thyroid gland (thyrotropin [TSH]), the adrenal gland (corticotropin [ACTH]), and the gonads (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]). The production of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is also modulated by hypothalamic substances. These two hormones, however, exert their effects directly upon the tissues of the body rather than through stimulation of other hormones. Growth hormone is responsible for growth of the skeleton before epiphyseal closure and, in the adult, maintains normal fat, muscle, glucose, and skeletal metabolism, as well as a sense of well-being. For women, prolactin is necessary for lactation following delivery and for milk production in the suckling process. Its role in the male has not been ascertained.\n\nThe posterior lobe of the pituitary is an extension of hypothalamic neurons. It is the location where antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) and oxytocin are converted from their prohormone state and released into the blood. Antidiuretic hormone regulates the fluid balance of the body through its ability to influence the excretion of water. The actions of oxytocin may have a role in the process of labor.\n\nPermanent impairments due to altered function of the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, gonads, and growth hormone are discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter.\n\n\n10.2 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nHypothalamic and pituitary diseases can cause impairments through either structural abnormalities or alterations in hormone production. Structural changes resulting in end-organ impairment are considered in the relevant chapter. Visual field abnormalities are considered in Chapter 12, The Visual System. Temporal lobe seizures, frontal lobe abnormalities, obstructive hydrocephalus, and nonendocrine hypothalamic dysfunction are considered in Chapter 13, The Nervous System.\n\nHypersecretion by the anterior lobe may be manifested by (1) prolactin hypersecretion resulting from a microadenoma or macroadenoma (prolactinoma),\n(2) growth hormone hypersecretion caused by a pituitary adenoma, or (3) corticotropin hypersecretion leading to adrenocortical hyperfunction. Prolactin excess results in hypogonadism, which in women may lead to amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, infertility, varying degrees of estrogen deficiency with its detrimental effect on the vascular and skeletal systems, decreased libido, and galactorrhea. In men, it may result in decreased libido, impotence, or infertility. Impairment from prolactin excess is equivalent to gonadotropic deficiency of the appropriate end organ, that is, secondary ovarian failure in women and testicular failure in men. Gonadal failure is discussed further in Section 10.8 of this chapter.",
  "Section 71 - 3150 chars": "When growth hormone hypersecretion occurs before epiphyseal closure, gigantism results; when hypersecretion occurs in the adult, acromegaly results. The manifestations of acromegaly include enlargement of the hands and feet, coarseness of facial features, and prognathism. Fatigue and increased perspiration are common symptoms. Acromegaly of long duration leads to morbidity from degenerative arthritis, peripheral neuropathy, and shortened life expectancy resulting from an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Growth hormone excess may lead to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and it may precipitate or exacerbate diabetes mellitus.\n\nHyposecretion of a single or of multiple anterior lobe hormones is known as hypopituitarism, and the deficiencies may be either partial or complete. In the adult years, pituitary tumors, infarction (especially postpartum infarction), and surgical or radiotherapeutic interventions are the most common causes, with a lower incidence caused by granulomatous and infiltrative diseases and head trauma.\n\nIn adults, hypopituitarism most often results in hypogonadism and a deficiency of growth hormone production. The most common symptoms of hypogonadism in men are impotence, weakness, decreased motivation, and depression. The most common presenting symptom of hypogonadism in women is amenorrhea. Growth hormone deficiency is accompanied most often by muscle weakness and reduced exercise capacity, fat accumulation (especially intraabdominal), decreased bone density, lack of motivation, a poor sense of well-being, and social isolation. Postpartum pituitary infarction also results in an inability to lactate. Hypopituitarism in a person with diabetes mellitus results in decreasing insulin requirements with an increased incidence of hypoglycemic episodes. Effects of dysfunction of TSH and ACTH secretion will be discussed in Sections\n\n10.3 and 10.5, respectively.\n\nHyperfunction of the posterior lobe, which causes the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), may result from a variety of central nervous system disorders; however, SIADH is rarely permanent. Inability of the kidneys to secrete a water load leads to hyponatremia if water intake is not restricted. Fatigue and lethargy, progressing to confusion, coma, and seizures, may result depending on the degree of hyponatremia.\n\nHypofunction of the posterior lobe results in ADH deficiency and diabetes insipidus. Hypofunction usually stems from diseases involving the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk and, less commonly, from diseases of the pituitary gland itself. The hypofunction may be hereditary, or it may be related to trauma, surgery, metastatic tumors, craniopharyngioma, histiocytosis X, or other conditions. If thirst response is normal, diabetes insipidus is mostly an inconvenience because of polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia. If the inability to ingest an adequate amount of fluid ensues or if thirst is impaired because of concomitant hypothalamic disease, severe dehydration and hypernatremia may result, leading to central nervous system changes, eg, mental depression or coma.",
  "Section 72 - 3144 chars": "10.2 b Description of Clinical Studies Structural abnormalities are evaluated by roentgenograms of the sella turcica, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Angiography occasionally is required.\nEvaluation of visual fields may be needed; vision impairments are discussed in Guides Chapter 12, The Visual System.\n\nHormonal function must be assessed, and this is often done by stimulation or suppression testing. Growth hormone deficiency is assessed by measuring GH in the blood after stimulation testing with insulin, exercise, levodopa, arginine, or other agents. Corticotropin deficiency is assessed by measuring serum corticotropin and cortisol levels and by stimulation testing with insulin or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).\n\nThe diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism (pituitary and hypothalamic hypothyroidism) is made by demonstrating low concentrations of thyroid hormones without elevation of the thyrotropin level. In this circumstance, CT scanning or MRI and tests of pituitary function, including measurement of thyrotropin secretion after an injection of protirelin (TRH), are needed to determine whether the hypothalamus or the pituitary is responsible. Secondary gonadal insufficiency, that is, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, requires the demonstration of endorgan failure, with low testosterone levels in men and low estrogen levels in women, as well as low or normal levels of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH.\n\nInsufficiency of antidiuretic hormone requires the documentation of urine hyposmolality in the face of a stimulus to concentrate urine, usually water restriction. Subsequently, an increase in urine osmolality in response to ADH administration must be demonstrated. Prolactin deficiency is documented by low basal levels of the hormone and its failure to increase after an injection of TRH, chlorpromazine, or other stimulating agents.\n\nGrowth hormone excess is documented by the failure to suppress GH concentration after a glucose load.\nProlactin excess is documented by measurement of elevated basal levels of prolactin. Inappropriate secretion of ADH is documented by hyponatremia with inappropriately elevated urine osmolality, in the presence of normal cardiac, renal, adrenal, and thyroid function.\n\n\n10.2 c Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Disorders\nThe assessment of permanent impairment of the whole person from disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis requires evaluation of (l) primary abnormalities related to GH, prolactin, or ADH; (2) secondary abnormalities in other endocrine glands, such as thyroid, adrenal, and gonads; and (3) structural and functional disorders of the central nervous system caused by anatomic abnormalities of the pituitary.\n\nThe examiner must evaluate each disorder separately, using the guidelines in this or other chapters, such as those on the visual system (Chapter 12), nervous system (Chapter 13), or mental and behavioral disorders (Chapter 14). The estimated impairments of the various organ systems then should be combined by means of the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).",
  "Section 73 - 3153 chars": "Criteria for evaluating permanent impairment resulting from hypothalamic-pituitary axis disorders are given in Table 10-1.\n\nAn individual with hypothalamic-pituitary disease belongs in class 1 when the disease can be controlled effectively with continuous treatment, with minimal impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living. If a person does not take the medication, a different degree of impairment may result.\n\nAn individual with hypothalamic-pituitary disease belongs in class 2 when the related symptoms and signs are inadequately controlled by treatment and impact ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\nAn individual with hypothalamic-pituitary disease belongs in class 3 when severe symptoms and signs persist despite treatment and significantly impact ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\n\n10.3 Thyroid\n\n\n10.3 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nThe thyroid gland, through its secretion of hormones, influences the metabolic rate of many organ systems. Hypersecretion and hyposecretion of thyroid hormones cause impairments. Hypersecretion by the thyroid gland results in hyperthyroidism and may be manifested by nervousness, weight loss, heat intolerance, goiter, tachycardia, palpitation, atrial fibrillation, frequent bowel movements, tremor, and muscle weakness. Eye changes, such as exophthalmos and double vision, may also be present. Hyposecretion by the thyroid gland results in hypothyroidism and may be manifested by lethargy, slowing of mental processes, weakness, cold intolerance, dry skin, constipation, and myxedema. Late complications include myocardial insufficiency, effusions into body cavities, and coma. Hypothyroidism in infancy may be associated with failure of physical and mental development.\n\n10.3\nb Description of Clinical Studies These include, but are not limited to, determination of (1) circulating thyroid hormone levels, including\ntotal thyroxine, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine; (2) circulating pituitary thyrotropin level measured by a sensitive assay;\n(3) radioiodine uptake of the thyroid gland; (4) thyroid antibodies; and (5) radiotriiodothyronine resin or red blood cell uptake. The nature of thyroid nodules is often best evaluated by needle aspiration or biopsy.\n\n\n10.3 c Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Thyroid Disease\nIn practically all individuals with hyperthyroidism, the condition can be corrected by treatment and there is no loss in the ability to perform activities of daily living. However, the ophthalmopathy seen in some cases of hyperthyroidism may persist after treatment of the thyrotoxic state and result in permanent cosmetic disfigurement or visual impairment. In severe cases, loss of vision may result. These conditions should be evaluated as described in the chapters on the ear, nose, throat, and related structures (Chapter 11) and the visual system (Chapter 12). When atrial fibrillation persists following adequate treatment of hyperthyroidism, this condition should be evaluated as described in the chapters on the cardiovascular system (Chapters 3 and 4).",
  "Section 74 - 3371 chars": "In most instances, hypothyroidism can be controlled satisfactorily by the administration of thyroid medication. Occasionally, because of associated disease in other organ systems, full hormone replacement may not be possible.

The major abnormalities of the glands include hyperfunction, hypofunction, and carcinoma.\n\n\n10.4 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nHypersecretion of parathyroid hormone, or hyperparathyroidism, may be due to the hyperfunctioning of one gland, as with an adenoma, or that of all four glands, as with hyperplasia, or may result from a parathyroid carcinoma. Manifestations of this condition include lethargy, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and polyuria, and, in extreme cases, bone pain, renal calculi, renal failure, and coma.\n\nHyposecretion of parathyroid hormone, or hypoparathyroidism, may be congenital in origin or due to inadvertent removal of the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy, surgical excision for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism, or unknown causes.\nManifestations include chronic fatigue, paresthesia, tetany, and seizures. Additionally, in idiopathic cases, there may be cataracts, chronic moniliasis of the skin, alopecia, and hypofunction of other endocrine organs, including hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and pernicious anemia.\n\n10.4\nb Description of Clinical Studies Techniques for evaluating parathyroid gland function include determinations of serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, creatinine, magnesium, parathyroid hormone levels, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, calcium concentration in urine, and urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate response to intravenously administered parathyroid hormone. Intravenous pyelography, skeletal roentgenography, and bone density studies may be useful. Ultrasonography, MRI, and CT and sestamibi scanning are useful tools in localizing parathyroid adenomas.\n\n\n10.4 c Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Parathyroid Disease\nHyperparathyroidism\nIn most cases of hyperparathyroidism, surgical treatment results in correction of the primary abnormality, although secondary symptoms and signs may persist, such as fracture, renal calculi, or renal failure. The latter signs should be evaluated according to criteria in the chapters on the urinary and reproductive systems (Chapter 7) or musculoskeletal system (Chapters 15 through 17). If surgery fails, or if the individual cannot undergo surgery, long-term therapy may be necessary, in which case the permanent impairment may be classified according to the criteria in Table 10-3.",
  "Section 75 - 3070 chars": "Hypoparathyroidism\nHypoparathyroidism is a chronic condition of variable severity that requires long-term medical therapy in most cases. The degree of severity determines the estimated permanent impairment rating, as Table 10-4 indicates.\n\n\n10.5  Adrenal Cortex\nThe adrenal cortex synthesizes and secretes adrenocortical hormones. These hormones participate in the regulation of electrolyte and water metabolism and in the intermediate metabolism of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. They also affect inflammatory response, cell membrane permeability, and immunologic responses, and they play a role in the development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nImpairment may result from either hypersecretion or hyposecretion of the cortical hormones. Such abnormalities may be associated with dysfunction of another endocrine gland, for example, the pituitary. If this occurs, the adrenal impairment and the impairment related to the other gland are both evaluated, and the impairments are combined by means of the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) to determine the whole person impairment.\n\n\n10.5 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nHypersecretion of adrenocortical hormones results from hyperplasia or from benign or malignant tumors of the adrenal cortex. The symptoms and signs of adrenocortical disease may arise from hypersecretion of one or more of the following hormones: (1) glucocorticoids, (2) mineralocorticoids,\n(3) androgens, and (4) estrogens. In some instances, there may be hypersecretion of hormones in one category and hyposecretion of those in another. Iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s syndrome secondary to supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids administered for systemic diseases such as bronchial asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis is the most common condition related to adrenal hormonal excess.\n\nAmong the diseases caused by hypersecretion of the adrenocortical hormones are Cushing\u2019s syndrome, the adrenogenital syndrome, and primary aldosteronism. Hypersecretion of the adrenal cortex caused by hyperplasia may be associated either with a tumor of the anterior pituitary gland or with a malignant tumor that arises outside the endocrine system and causes ectopic corticotropin secretion.\n\nHyposecretion of adrenocortical hormones may be primary, resulting from surgical removal or destruction of the adrenals, as with Addison\u2019s disease or by metastatic cancer; secondary, resulting from decreased production of corticotropin; or tertiary, resulting from decreased production of corticotropinreleasing hormone by the hypothalamus. Therapy is guided by the number of hormonal deficiencies, which may be single, as in hypoaldosteronism, or multiple, as in adrenocortical destruction. One normal adrenal gland can compensate for the loss of the other.\n\n\n10.5 b Description of Clinical Studies These techniques include (1) measurement of adrenocortical hormones in the urine, such as free cortisol and aldosterone, and of hormones in the plasma, such as cortisol and aldosterone; (2) meas-",

Evaluation of improvement may be difficult because a person may be fully functional\non an everyday basis while taking replacement medication but not be able to respond properly to the stress of fever, trauma, infection, or very warm weather. This impaired ability to respond to stress needs careful consideration. Impairments should be classified according to Table 10-5.\n\nHyperadrenocorticism caused by the chronic side effects of supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, that is, iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s syndrome, is related to dosage and duration of treatment and may cause osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and the catabolic effects that result in cataracts, aseptic necrosis, myopathy, striae, and easy bruising.\nPermanent impairments may range from 0% to 100%, depending on the severity and chronicity of the disease process for which the steroids are given. Impairments from diseases of the pituitary-adrenal axis should be estimated according to Table 10-6.\n\n\u2020 The degree of estimated impairment will depend on the effects of the tumor on other organ systems; appropriate Guides chapters should be consulted\n\n\n10.6  Adrenal Medulla\n\n10.6 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nThe adrenal medulla synthesizes and secretes primarily epinephrine, which functions in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiac output and, to some extent, affects the intermediary metabolism of the body. The adrenal medulla is usually not essential to the maintenance of life or well-being. Its absence may constitute a permanent impairment rating if an abnormality is detected in the individual\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living, especially in the response to stress. Hyperfunction of the adrenal medulla may be caused by pheochromocytomas or, rarely, by hyperplasia of the chromaffin cells.\nPheochromocytomas may arise at any site in the body that has sympathetic nervous tissue. The presence of a pheochromocytoma is usually associated with paroxysmal or sustained hypertension and may produce manifestations of coronary artery disease. Pheochromocytomas may be multiple in an individual and may occur in families in association with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and hyperplasia of the parathyroids; this constitutes the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia. Approximately 10% of pheochromocytomas are malignant.\n\n\n10.6 b Description of Clinical Studies\nThese techniques include (1) measurement of unmetabolized urinary catecholamines, including total catecholamines, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, and of their degradation products in urine, vanillylmandelic acid, and metanephrines; (2) measurement of the plasma catecholamines, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine; (3) suppressive response of catecholamines to oral clonidine; (4) radiography of the adrenals by CT scanning and MRI; and (5) nucleotide scanning with 123I/ 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG).",

Both hormones are required for the maintenance of normal metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.\nPermanent impairment may result from a deficiency or an excess of either hormone. Removal of normal pancreatic tissue during the resection of an islet cell neoplasm does not constitute an endocrine impairment if, after the operation, the individual\u2019s carbohydrate tolerance is normal.\n\n10.7\na Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nAbnormalities of islet cell function may be manifested by high plasma glucose levels, as in diabetes mellitus, or by low plasma glucose levels, as in hypoglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is classified into two main groups: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The complications of diabetes mellitus fall into two general categories: (1) those that are directly related to the degree of hyperglycemia and (2) the chronic complications resulting from inadequate control of hyperglycemia and lipid metabolism over many years.\n\nPeople with type 1, if untreated, will develop severe hyperglycemia and ketonemia, resulting in dehydration, weight loss, and severe weakness, ultimately progressing into stupor, coma, and then death. This type of diabetes mellitus usually begins in young persons, but it may occur at any age.\n\nPeople with type 2 generally are over 40 years old and overweight. In the early years of this disease, these people do not develop severe hyperglycemia and its associated symptoms and, indeed, may not experience any symptoms of the disease. In later years, when insulin production falls significantly, the hyperglycemic symptoms become more evident.\n\nThe main chronic complications of diabetes mellitus and associated impairments are (1) retinopathy, causing visual impairment; (2) nephropathy, causing renal impairment; (3) neuropathy, causing various neuropathic impairments; and (4) atherosclerosis, causing atherosclerotic heart disease, as well as cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease.\n\nHypoglycemia occasionally causes impairment. It may result from excessive insulin that either is produced endogenously or administered by injection. Hypoglycemia may be manifested by weakness, sweating, tachycardia, headache, confusion, muscular incoordination, blurred vision, loss of consciousness, and convulsions. Prolonged hypoglycemia or repeated severe attacks of hypoglycemia may lead to mental deterioration and brain damage.\n\n\n10.7 b Diabetes Mellitus\nDescription of Clinical Studies\nThese techniques include, but are not limited to (1) determination of fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels; (2) determination of hemoglobin A1c level; (3) measurements of levels of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and other lipids; (4) electrocardiogram or cardiac stress testing;",
  "Section 78 - 3326 chars": "(5) ophthalmologic examination; (6) tests of renal function, including measurement of serum creatinine and urinary protein excretion; (7) Doppler testing of the peripheral circulation; (8) roentgenograms of the chest, gastrointestinal tract, pelvis, or extremities, including arteriograms; and (9) neurologic testing.\n\nAlthough it may be useful to examine the results from blood glucose testing done by the individual at home in order to obtain an additional measure of the degree of glucose control, one must recognize that these measurements may be less objective than laboratory methods such as self-hemoglobin A1c measurement.\n\nMuch of the impairment that results from diabetes is related to the chronic complications. Therefore, the examiner must not only determine the presence or absence of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, but also evaluate the other systems that may be involved. Impairments of other systems would be expressed as whole person impairments and then combined with an impairment percent resulting from instability of glucose control by means of the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\nCriteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Diabetes Mellitus\nPermanent impairment from diabetes mellitus can be rated using the criteria given in Table 10-8.\n\nDistinction must be made between the presence of postprandial and postabsorptive hypoglycemia, since postabsorptive hypoglycemia suggests the possibility of a severe or even fatal disorder, whereas postprandial hypoglycemia is usually self-limited and rarely produces physical impairment.\n\nThe techniques used include, but are not limited to\n(1) measurement of plasma glucose and insulin or Cpeptide after overnight or longer periods of fasting, on several occasions; (2) roentgenograms of the skull and chest and CT scan or MRI of the upper abdomen; (3) tests of liver function; and (4) tests of adrenocortical and pituitary gland function. Documented hypoglycemia requires a detailed medical evaluation to determine the specific cause.\n\nCriteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Hypoglycemia\nThe criteria for rating permanent impairment due to hypoglycemia are given in Table 10-9.\n\n\n10.8 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nPrecocious puberty in boys is accompanied by early and rapid somatic development and an increased rate of skeletal maturation and height velocity, but, paradoxically, it results in short adult height. It may result from various central nervous system disorders, adrenal enzyme defects, virilizing tumors, or\u2014occasionally\u2014as a familial condition.\n\nPrecocious puberty in girls may also be caused by various central nervous system disorders, as well as by ovarian and adrenal tumors. Often, a cause is not identified. As in boys, precocious puberty in girls results in early and rapid somatic development and an increased rate of skeletal maturation and height velocity, with ultimately short adult height. Some ovarian tumors may cause masculinization.\n\nSome adrenal enzyme defects and neoplasms, as well as some gonadal neoplasms, may produce contrasexual precocity. Certain ovarian conditions produce irregular menstrual periods with heavy bleeding and anemia. Polycystic ovarian syndrome and several types of ovarian neoplasms may produce severe hirsutism and virilization, in addition to anovulation.",

Growth of the body extends beyond the usual age because of delayed epiphyseal closure.\nIndividuals with this condition usually lack endurance and strength. Testicular hypofunction that occurs in adulthood results in varying degrees of regression of secondary sexual characteristics, sexual function, strength, and endurance, and it may also be accompanied by infertility.\n\nOvarian hypofunction, with onset before adolescence, may be characterized by primary amenorrhea, anovulation, poor development of secondary sexual characteristics, and growth beyond the usual age because of delayed maturation of the skeleton.\nMenopause is a natural occurrence in older women, but it also may follow surgical removal of the ovaries. It may be accompanied by such symptoms as hot flashes, irritability, fatigue, and headaches. If not treated, osteoporosis and an enhancement of atherosclerosis may occur during later years.\n\n\n10.8 b Description of Clinical Studies\nThese techniques include, but are not limited to\n(1) measurements of plasma gonadotropins, prolactin, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, DHEAS, androstenedione, and occasionally 17-ketosteroids in the urine; (2) radiographic determinations of skeletal age in children and adolescents; (3) CT scans or MRI to evaluate the pituitary, adrenals, and ovaries; (4) sex chromatin and chromosome studies;\n(5) testicular biopsy; (6) semen analysis; (7) vaginal cytologic examination; (8) culdoscopy or laparoscopy; (9) endometrial biopsy; (10) ovarian biopsy; and (11) pelvic ultrasound in women.\n\n\n10.8 c Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Disorders of the Gonads\nAn individual with anatomic loss or alteration of the gonads that results in an absence, or an abnormally high level, of gonadal hormones would have 0% to 35% impairment of the whole person, as detailed in Chapter 7, The Urinary and Reproductive Systems. Impairment resulting from inability to reproduce, and other impairments associated with gonadal dysfunction, should be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in Chapter 7.\n\n\n10.9 a Criteria for Rating Permanent Impairment Due to Mammary Gland Disorders\nA female of childbearing age with absence of the breasts, an individual with galactorrhea sufficient to require the use of absorbent pads, and a male with painful gynecomastia that interferes with performance of activities of daily living each would have 0% to 5% impairment of the whole person. If there were a coexisting psychiatric impairment, the whole person impairment would be greater (see Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders).\n\n\n10.10 Metabolic Bone Disease\nMetabolic bone disease usually does not result in impairment unless there is fracture, pain, deformity, or peripheral nerve entrapment. Hyperparathyroidism, hypogonadism, glucocorticoid excess, hyperthyroidism, nutritional deficiencies, and certain drugs may cause osteoporosis, which is reversible with treatment, and are discussed elsewhere, as are multiple myeloma and other malignancies. The treatment of renal osteodystrophy may be highly successful, but even after renal transplantation, bone disease may persist. In order to prevent progressive skeletal deterioration, continuous treatment may be required for primary osteoporosis, hypogonadism, Paget\u2019s disease, and vitamin D-resistant osteomalacia. Permanent deformity may result from rickets, osteoporotic fractures, and osteogenesis imperfecta.",

When continuous hormone and mineral therapy gives complete relief of symptoms, impairment of the whole person may be considered to be 0% to 3%. When continuous therapy is required to relieve pain and the activities of daily living are restricted, the estimate should be 5% to 15% impairment of the whole person.\n\nImpairment from fracture, spinal collapse, or other complications of metabolic bone disease is discussed in the chapters on the musculoskeletal system (Chapters 15-17) and pain (Chapter 18). In general, the impairment percents shown in the Guides chapters make allowance for the pain that may accompany the impairing conditions.

Assess permanent impairment ratings of these structures by evaluating losses in structure or the following functions: hearing; equilibrium; respiration; mastication, olfaction, and taste; speech\nand voice; and the effect of these losses on the ability to perform activities of daily living. Impairment criteria, listed in earlier editions of the Guides,\nwere adapted from the American Academy of Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery.1 Abbreviations and their definitions are listed in the Glossary.\n\nThe following sections have been revised for the fifth edition: a new section has been added on the evaluation of voice impairment, facial disorders and disfigurements have been combined, and case examples have been added to the impairment classes.\n\n11.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluations.\n\nAssistive devices must not be used during the determination of a hearing impairment rating. The use of such devices might give a false impression of a subject\u2019s sensitivity and distort the need to take hearing conservation or other indicated measures. As stated in Chapter 1, report measured hearing with and without an assistive device. However, only the measurement without the assistive device should be used to determine the impairment rating.\n\n\n11.1 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nBegin the evaluation with an inquiry into specific symptoms and their severity, duration, and manner of onset. The history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies may enable identification of the diagnosis, a management plan, and prognosis. Since the ear, nose, throat, and related structures have distinct functions, disorders of each system will be covered separately in this chapter. Permanent impairments of each system with nonoverlapping functional losses are evaluated separately and then combined.\n\nSome impairment classes refer to limitations in the ability to perform daily activities. When this information is subjective and possibly misinterpreted, it should not serve as the sole criterion upon which decisions about impairment are made. Rather, obtain objective data about the severity of the findings and the limitations and integrate the findings with the subjective data to estimate the degree of permanent impairment.\n\n\n11.1 b Description of Clinical Studies Multiple and diverse tests are used to investigate the ear, nose, throat, and related structures. Some of these tests are discussed in the relevant organ system section and summarized in Table 11-10.",
  "Section 82 - 3247 chars": "11.2 The Ear\nThe ear consists of the auricle, the external canal, the tympanic membrane, the ossicles, the middle ear, the eustachian tube, the mastoid, and the internal ear.\nThe auditory and vestibular systems include the ear and central nervous system pathways.\n\nThe ear provides sensorineural input critical to the senses of hearing and balance. Hearing enables contact with environmental cues (eg, those that alert) and enables us to communicate socially. Balance contributes to maintenance of equilibrium in relation to the environment. Balance function is mediated by dynamically monitoring information about the position of the head, eyes, trunk, and joints at rest and with activity. Although hearing and balance disturbances can be objectively measured, other conditions, such as chronic otorrhea, otalgia, and tinnitus,2 are subjective, should be noted, but cannot be measured independently of the individual\u2019s self-reports.\n\nPermanent hearing impairment is a permanently reduced hearing sensitivity, outside the range of normal for the individual or based on population normal values.3 Hearing should be evaluated after maximum rehabilitation has been achieved and when the impairment is no longer accelerating beyond an ageappropriate rate.4 Evaluate hearing impairment based upon the individual\u2019s binaural hearing, determined from the pure-tone audiogram.\n\n\n11.2 a Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Hearing Loss\nCriteria for evaluating hearing impairment are established through hearing threshold testing, which serves as the most reproducible of the measures of hearing. Therefore, estimate an impairment percentage based on the severity of the hearing loss, which accounts for changes in the ability to perform activities of daily living. Tinnitus in the presence of unilateral or bilateral hearing impairment may impair speech discrimination. Therefore, add up to 5% for tinnitus in the presence of measurable hearing loss if the tinnitus impacts the ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\nIn the calculation of a hearing impairment rating, no correction for presbycusis should be made because:\n(1) the method below calculates the degree of hearing and assigns a rating, regardless of cause (eg, age, injury, or noise exposure); (2) age correction would result in a reduced binaural impairment score that would thus underestimate the true magnitude of the hearing impairment; and (3) estimation of the relative contributions of various causes of binaural hearing impairment is a clinical process (apportionment or allocation) that is separate from the calculation of binaural hearing impairment.\n\nHearing impairment is measured by evaluating hearing in each ear separately and both ears together, based on audiometric measurements. Hearing impairment is reported in each ear separately and both ears together.\n\nAudiometric Measurements to Determine Hearing Impairment\nIn determining impairments, the following steps should be taken.\n\n1. Test each ear separately with a pure-tone audiometer and record the hearing levels at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz. It is necessary that the hearing level for each frequency be determined in every subject. The following rules apply for extreme values:",
  "Section 83 - 3253 chars": "a. If the hearing level at a given frequency is greater than 100 dB or is beyond the range of the audiometer, the level should be taken as 100 dB.\nb. If the hearing level for a given frequency has a negative value (eg, \u20135 dB), the level should be taken as 0 dB.\n\n2. Add the four hearing levels (dB) for each ear separately. Hearing levels are determined according to ANSI Standard S3.6-1996.4\n\n3. Consult Table 11-1 to determine the percentages of monaural hearing impairment for each ear.\n\n4. Consult Table 11-2 to convert the monaural hearing impairment percentages to a binaural hearing impairment rating.\n\n5. Consult Table 11-3 to determine the impairment of the whole person.\n\n\u2020Decibel sum of the hearing threshold levels at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz.\n\nEvaluation of Monaural Hearing Impairment If the average of the hearing levels at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz is 25 dB or less, according to 1996 American National Standards Institute (ANSI) audiometric standards,4 no impairment rating is assigned since there is no change in the ability to hear everyday sounds under everyday listening conditions (Table 11-1). At the other extreme, if the average of the hearing levels at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz is more than 91.7 dB, the binaural hearing impairment rating is 100% since the individual has lost the ability to perform an activity of daily living\u2014the ability to hear everyday speech.1\n\nThe data from which this formula1 was developed indicate that the ability to hear everyday sounds under everyday listening conditions is not impaired when the average of the hearing levels at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz is 25 dB or less. The 25-dB \u201cfence\u201d represents this finding; it is not a compensatory adjustment for presbycusis, the hearing loss that occurs with age.\n\nThis method of evaluating hearing impairment should be applied only to adults who have acquired language skills. Evidence suggests that language acquisition by children who do not have language skills may be delayed when the average hearing level is in the range of 15 to 25 dB.\n\nAccording to the above standards for monaural hearing impairment, for every decibel that the average hearing level or loss for speech exceeds 25 dB, 1.5% of monaural impairment is assigned. Thus, with an average hearing level loss of 67 dB above 25 dB, monaural impairment is 100% (Table 11-1).\n\nEvaluation of Binaural Hearing Impairment Hearing impairment of both ears, referred to as binaural impairment, indicates a loss of hearing of greater than 25 dB in both ears at frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and/or 3000 Hz.\n\nBinaural impairment is determined by the following formula:\n\nnaural hearing impairment (%) = [5 x (% hearing impairment better ear)\n+ (% hearing impairment poorer ear)] 6\nTo calculate binaural impairment when only one ear exhibits hearing impairment, use the above formula, allowing 0% impairment for the unimpaired ear (the ear with the better hearing).\n\nAlternatively, use Table 11-2, which is derived from the formula given above, to calculate the value for binaural hearing impairment. Then apply the value for binaural hearing impairment to Table 11-3, which converts binaural hearing impairment to impairment of the whole person.",
  "Section 84 - 3485 chars": "11.2 b Equilibrium\nEquilibrium, or orientation in space, is maintained by the visual, kinesthetic, and vestibular mechanisms.\nWhen impairments of equilibrium are predominantly due to or have effects on other organ systems, the impairment should be evaluated in the relevant organ system, eg, disorders of the nervous system (Chapter 13), cardiovascular system (Chapters 3 and 4), and visual system (Chapter 12).\n\nDisturbances of equilibrium may be classified as follows: (1) vertigo, a sensation of rotation of the subject or of objects about the subject in any plane;\n(2) giddiness or lightheadedness, distinguished from vertigo by the absence of feelings of movement2; and\n(3) abnormalities of postural stability and/or standing balance with or without vertigo. Vertigo may be produced by disorders of the vestibular mechanism and its central nervous system components, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem, and by eye movements.\n\nPermanent impairment may result from any disorder causing vertigo or disorientation in space. Three regulatory systems\u2014vestibular, ocular (visual), and kinesthetic (proprioceptive)\u2014are related to the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The evaluation of impairments of equilibrium may include consideration of one or more of these mechanisms.5,6 This chapter addresses only disturbances in equilibrium due to vestibular disorders.\n\nClinical evaluations may include electronystagmography,2 caloric irrigation, positional and rotatory tests, dynamic posturography, Romberg and tandem Romberg tests, and radiological brain imaging studies. The results of these laboratory tests should be correlated with validated clinical measures of balance and ambulation to determine the true state of equilibratory dysfunction. For other causes of disequilibrium, see the relevant chapter, such as the neurologic system (Chapter 13), for central nervous system disorders.\n\nVestibular System\nPermanent impairment can result from defects of the vestibular (labyrinthine) mechanism and its central connections. The defects are evidenced by loss of equilibrium produced by disturbance or loss of vestibular function.\n\nComplete loss of vestibular function may be unilateral or bilateral. When the loss is unilateral, adequate central nervous system compensation may or may not occur. With total bilateral loss of vestibular function, equilibrium is totally dependent on the kinesthetic and visual systems, which usually are unable to compensate fully for movement or ambulation.\nDepending on the ability to perform activities of daily living, the percentage of permanent impairment of the whole person may range from 0% to 95%.\n\nDisturbances of vestibular function are evidenced by vertigo (vestibular dysequilibrium) as defined above. Lightheadedness and abnormalities of gait not associated with vertigo are not defined here as being disturbances of vestibular function.\n\nVertigo may be accompanied by varying degrees of nausea, vomiting, headache, immobility, ataxia, and nystagmus. Movement may increase the vertigo and the accompanying signs and symptoms. Peripheral vestibular (labyrinthine) disorders are often associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Vestibular disorders may result in temporary or permanent impairments. Evaluation of vestibular impairment should be performed when the condition is stable and maximum adjustment has been achieved, which generally is considered to occur months after resolution of the disease or injury.5,6",
  "Section 85 - 3285 chars": "The classification in Table 11-4 has been developed for evaluation of those individuals with permanent disturbances of the vestibular mechanism. The impairment ratings reflect the severity of the permanent impairment and the ability of the individual to perform activities of daily living. Since vestibular disorders are dynamic, assessment of permanent impairment should be based on determination of the person\u2019s condition after it is stable. Although symptoms may be intermittent, the examiner needs to gauge functioning during episodes with exacerbations. Vestibular impairment as defined here is rated similarly in Chapter 13.\n\n\n11.3  The Face\nThe face, its parts, and its structural components serve multiple functions: protection of underlying structures and organs (such as the eyes), portals of entry for deglutition and respiration, and communication through expression and speech.\n\nThe skin covers the body, acts as a physical barrier to underlying structures, provides sensory perception, regulates temperature and body fluids, and resists trauma. See Chapter 8 for primary skin impairments.\n\nThe portal for deglutition is the mouth and lips. Disturbances in function can result in drooling or inability to keep food or liquid in the mouth while eating. The lips and mouth also serve in vocal articulation, adding intelligibility to speech. The nose and mouth are the portals of entry for respiration.\nImpairment may be a result of neurologic disorders, such as partial or complete paralysis of the lips; scar formation and contracture of the lips; or loss of tissue.\n\nThe face plays a unique role in communication. No other part of the body serves as specific a function for personal identity and for the expression of thought and emotion. Facial expressions are an integral part of normal living postures. A degree of normalcy is needed for effective verbal and nonverbal communication. Facial anatomy contributes to identity, expression, and normal functioning, and to the appearance of the forehead and cheeks; eyes, eyelids, and eyebrows; lips and mouth; nose; and chin and neck. The face is such a prominent feature that it plays a critical role in the individual\u2019s physical, psychological, and emotional makeup. Facial disfigurement can affect all of these components and can result in social and vocational handicaps and even psychiatric impairment.\n\n11.3\na Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Facial Disorders and/or Disfigurement To evaluate permanent impairment due to a disorder or disfigurement of the face, consider changes in anatomy and function and the effect of the impairment on the ability to perform activities of daily living. This section deals with permanent impairment as it relates mainly to the face\u2019s structural integrity. For loss of function involving other aspects of the functioning of the face, refer to the specific organ system involved and combine the structural integrity loss with the relevant loss of function. Loss of structural integrity can result from cutaneous disfigurement, such as that due to abnormal pigmentation or scars, or from loss of supporting structures, such as soft tissue, bone, or cartilage of the facial skeleton. Other information on cutaneous disfigurement appears in Chapter 8 (The Skin).",
  "Section 86 - 3145 chars": "Disfigurement of the face can result from many causes, particularly burns, traumatic injury, surgery, infections, or dysplasia. Effects on individuals can vary tremendously, as can remaining function. Total disfigurement of the face after treatment should be deemed a 16% to 50% impairment of the whole person, dependent also upon the degree of functional loss. For the assessment of psychosocial impairment due to disfigurement, refer to Chapter 14 on mental and behavioral disorders.\n\nFacial disfigurement may be considered total if it is severe and grossly deforming of the face and features. Such disfigurement must involve at least the entire area between the brow line and the upper lip on both sides. Severe disfigurement above the brow line should be deemed to be, at a maximum, 1% impairment of the whole person. If disfigurement is severe below the upper lip, it may be deemed to be 8% impairment of the whole person. Specific, prominent facial disfigurements are estimated as shown in Table 11-5.\n\nComment: No loss of nasal function or nasal bone structural integrity. Appearance of nose did not change. Scar falls in skinfold line and is barely visible.\n\nThe functions of these structures, and the order in which they will be discussed, are as follows: (1) respiration, (2) mastication and deglutition, (3) olfaction and taste, and (4) speech. Permanent impairment may result from a deviation from normal in any of the above functions, and, because of their close relationship, more than one structure may be involved.\n\n\n11.4a Respiration\nRespiration may be defined as the act or function of breathing, that is, the act by which air is inspired and expired from the lungs. The respiratory mechanism includes the lungs and the air passages; the latter includes the nares, nasal cavities, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi.\n\nIn this chapter, discussion of permanent impairments related to respiration is limited to defects of the air passages. Refer to Chapter 5 on the respiratory system for a discussion of impairments of the lower airways and lung parenchyma.\n\nThe most commonly encountered defect of the air passages is obstruction, which may be partial, as with stenosis, or complete, as with occlusion.\nObstructions and other air passage defects are evidenced primarily by dyspnea or so-called unusual breathlessness. Sleep apnea, which is covered in Chapter 5, may be related to functional upper-airway obstruction.\n\nDyspnea is a cardinal factor that contributes to an individual\u2019s diminished capacity to carry out activities of daily living and to permanent impairment.\nThis subjective complaint or symptom, which indicates an awareness of respiratory distress, usually is noted first and is most severe during exercise. When dyspnea occurs at rest, respiratory dysfunction probably is severe. Dyspnea may or may not be accompanied by related signs or symptoms.\n\nIndividuals with air passage defects may be evaluated in accordance with the classification in Table 11-6. Permanent impairments involving obstructive sleep apnea should be evaluated with the respiratory system criteria described in Chapter 5.",
  "Section 87 - 3121 chars": "Note: Individuals with successful permanent tracheostomy or stoma should be rated at 25% impairment of the whole person.\n\n\n11.4 b Mastication and Deglutition\nThe act of eating includes mastication and deglutition. Numerous conditions of nongastrointestinal origin, singly or in combination, may interfere with these functions.\n\nDysfunction of the temporomandibular joint may impede mastication, affect speech, cause lower facial deformity, and produce pain.7,8 In this section, the effect of temporomandibular joint dysfunction on eating is considered; other effects may be considered in conjunction with parts of the Guides that deal with the nervous system or pain.\n\nIn accordance with the philosophy of the Guides, when mastication and deglutition are evaluated, the ability to eat should be stable and maximal rehabilitation should have been achieved. When mastication or deglutition is impaired, the imposition of dietary restrictions usually results. Such restrictions are the most objective criteria by which to evaluate permanent impairment of these functions.9-14 The relationship of the restrictions to impairments of mastication and deglutition are shown in Table 11-7.\n\n\n11.4c Olfaction and Taste\nOnly rarely does complete loss of the closely related senses of olfaction and taste seriously affect an individual\u2019s performance of the usual activities of daily living. For this reason, a value of 1% to 5% impairment of the whole person is suggested for use in cases involving partial or complete bilateral loss of either sense due to peripheral lesions. This value is to be combined with any other impairment of the individual (see the Combined Values Chart, p. 604).\n\n\n11.4d Speech\nIn this chapter, speech is defined as the capacity to produce vocal signals that can be heard, understood, and sustained over a useful period of time. Speech ought to allow effective communication in the activities of daily living.\n\nThis chapter does not consider the causes and characteristics of abnormal speech. Rather, it considers how an impairment relates to the individual\u2019s ability or efficiency in using speech to make himself or herself understood in activities of daily living. It is assumed that speech evaluation pertains to the production of voice and articulate speech and not to the language content or structure of the individual\u2019s communication. On the basis of these assumptions, the primary problem is estimating proficiency in the use of oral language or measuring the utility of speech as defined above. This section also considers esophageal speech.\n\nAt this time there is no single, acceptable, proven test that will measure objectively the degrees of impairment due to the many varieties of speech disorders. Therefore, it is recommended that speech impairment be evaluated by examining the audibility, intelligibility, and functional efficiency of speech.\n\u2022 Audibility is based on the ability to speak at a level sufficient to be heard.\n\u2022 Intelligibility is based on the ability to articulate and to link phonetic units of speech with sufficient accuracy to be understood.",
  "Section 88 - 3037 chars": "\u2022 Functional efficiency is based on the ability to produce a satisfactorily rapid rate of speaking and to sustain this rate over a useful period of time.\n\nOther definable attributes of speech\u2013such as voice quality, pitch, and melodic variation\u2013are evaluated only when they affect one of the three primary characteristics noted above.\n\nThe classification chart, oral reading paragraph, and examining procedure used in estimating speech impairment are described below.\n\nClassification Chart\nJudgments as to the amount of impairment should be made with reference to the classes, percentages, and examples provided in the classification chart (Table 11-8). The 15 categories in the chart suggest\nactivities or situations with different levels of impairment. Data gathered from direct observation of the individual or from interviews should be compared with these categories, and values should be assigned on the basis of the specific impairments that are present.\n\nOral Reading Paragraph\nThe following paragraph, entitled \u201cThe Smith House,\u201d is composed of 100 words and 10 sentences. It provides a uniform means of comparing a speech sample of the person being evaluated with the speech of normal speakers. The phonetic elements of the paragraph are selected particularly for their relevance to the intelligibility of the person\u2019s speech.\nThe Smith House\nLarry and Ruth Smith have been married nearly 14\nyears. They have a small place near Long Lake. Both of them think there\u2019s nothing like the country for health. Their two boys would rather live here than any other place. Larry likes to keep some saddle horses close to the house. These make it easy to keep his sons amused. If they wish, the boys can go fishing along the shore. When it rains, they usually want to watch television. Ruth has a cherry tree on each side of the kitchen door. In June they enjoy the juice and jelly.\n\nExamining Procedure\nGeneral Orientation\nThe examiner should have normal hearing as defined in the earlier section in this chapter on hearing. The setting of the examination should be a reasonably quiet room that approximates the noise levels of everyday living.\n\nThe examiner should base judgments of impairment on two kinds of evidence: (1) attention to and observation of the individual\u2019s speech in the office\u2014for example, during conversation, during the interview, and while reading and counting aloud\u2014and (2) reports pertaining to the individual\u2019s performance in everyday living situations. The reports or the evidence should be supplied by reliable observers who know the person well. The standard of evaluation is an average speaker\u2019s performance in average situations of everyday living. It is assumed in this context that an average speaker can usually perform according to the following criteria:\n\n\u2022 Talk in a loud voice when the occasion demands it.\n\u2022 Sustain phonation for at least 10 seconds after one breath.\n\u2022 Complete at least a 10-word sentence in one breath.\n\u2022 Form all of the phonetic units of American speech and join them intelligibly.",
  "Section 89 - 3326 chars": "\u2022 Maintain a speech rate of at least 75 to 100 words per minute and sustain a flow of speech for a reasonable length of time. A speech rate of 125 words per minute enables a speaker to read approximately one 81/2 x 11-inch page of double-spaced text in 2 minutes.\n\nSpecific Instructions\n\n1. Place the individual approximately 8 ft from the examiner.\n\n2. Interview the individual. This will permit observation of his or her speech in ordinary conversation while pertinent historical information is obtained.\n\n3. Have the individual\u2019s back toward the examiner and keep a separation of 8 ft between the examiner and the examinee. Instruct the person as follows: \u201cYou are to read this passage so I can hear you plainly. Be sure to speak so I can understand you.\u201d Then ask him or her to read aloud the short paragraph, \u201cThe Smith House.\u201d\n\n4. If additional reading procedures are required, simple prose paragraphs from a magazine may be used. A person who cannot read may be\nrequested to give his or her name and address and name all the days of the week and months of the year. Additional evidence regarding the person\u2019s rate of speech and ability to sustain it may be obtained by noting the time required to count to 100 by ones. Completion of this task in 60 to 75 seconds is accepted as normal.\n\n5. Record judgment of the individual\u2019s speech capacity with regard to each of the three rows of the classification chart (Table 11-8). The degree of impairment of speech is equivalent to the greatest percentage of impairment recorded in any one of the three rows of the classification chart.\n\nFor example, a person\u2019s speech capacity is judged to be the following: audibility, 10% (class 1); intelligibility, 50% (class 3); and functional efficiency,\n\n30% (class 2). The individual\u2019s speech impairment is judged to be equivalent to the greatest impairment (50%). A speech impairment of 50% is judged to be an 18% impairment of the whole person, according to Table 11-9.\n\n\n11.4e Voice\nVoice, as the term is used in this section, refers to the production of audible sounds by the vibration of the true vocal folds of the larynx. Voice, or phonation, is therefore the generator of speech\u2014the shaping of sounds into intelligible words. Alternative physiological sound generators, such as the false vocal folds or the esophagus, are not considered here.\n\nThis section does not consider the causes of voice disorders. Rather, it recognizes that voice disorders may present such definable symptoms as abnormal volume (voice fatigue, weakness, or low sound intensity), abnormal control (pitch and/or melodic variation), and/or abnormal quality (hoarseness, harshness, or breathiness). These symptoms indicate abnormal physiological functioning of the phonatory mechanism and may contribute to impairment of speech.\n\nAt this time, there is no single, acceptable, proven test that will measure objectively the degrees of impairment associated with the many varieties of voice disorders. Tests such as laryngoscopy, acoustical analysis of voice, strobovideolaryngoscopy, analysis of phonatory function, and laryngeal electromyography are recognized as appropriate and useful.15-17 The significance of current normative data is unclear when confined to consideration of impairment.",

The visual system consists of the eyes and supporting structures, the neural pathways, and the visual cortex of the brain. The visual system is unique in that it\ncombines the input from two separate eyes into a single visual perception.\n\nThis chapter focuses on functional impairment of the visual system as a whole. The impairment ratings in this chapter estimate the severity of the effects of certain types of vision loss on the ability to perform activities of daily living. Changes due to abnormalities in the optic nerve or visual cortex are also discussed in Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System.\n\nThis chapter has been significantly revised from the fourth edition of the Guides. The revision was based on a consensus within the international community of experts in low vision. Individuals interested in further discussion, including an emphasis on ability, can refer to the Guide for the Evaluation of Visual Impairment, published for the International Society for Low Vision Research and Rehabilitation.12 A summary of revisions follows.\n\n1. The Visual Efficiency Scale that was used up to the fourth edition of the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment22, 23 was developed by Snell in 1925.19-21 This scale was replaced with the Functional Vision Score (FVS).17 The FVS provides an estimate of the effect of certain types of vision loss on the ability to perform activities of daily living. On this scale, 20/200 is rated as a 50% impairment.",
  "Section 91 - 3005 chars": "2. The FVS is based on an assessment of visual acuity and visual field. The FVS allows for individual adjustments for other functional deficits, such as contrast and glare sensitivity, color vision, binocularity, stereopsis, suppression, and diplopia, if these deficits cause a significant ability loss that is not reflected in a visual acuity or visual field loss.\n\n3. The extra scale and losses for diplopia and aphakia have been removed. Recommendations to make adjustments on an individual basis, if needed, have been added.\n\n4. Near vision measurements are optional; the last section of this chapter contains a discussion on how to make the assessment of reading acuity more accurate.\n\n5. Visual field is recalculated using a new Visual Field Score (VFS). To better account for the functional significance of losses in the two lower quadrants, the lower visual field carries 50% more weight than the upper field. Hemianopia is also scored more appropriately.\n\n6. Visual impairment ratings are calculated using the formula (3 ? OU + OD + OS)/5 instead of the prior formula (3 ? better eye + 1 ? lesser eye)/4. The new formula better accounts for situations where the binocular function is not identical to the function of the better eye. This can be particularly important for dissimilar field losses.\n\n7.\nThis edition also calculates a binocular impairment value for visual acuity and for field loss before combining these into an estimate of total visual loss and functional vision.\n\n8. The impairment rating for the visual system = 100 \u2013 the FVS.\n\n\n12.1  Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations.\nThe Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.\n\nA permanent visual impairment is defined as a permanent loss of vision that remains after maximal medical improvement of the underlying medical condition has been reached. Ophthalmology has the capability to measure organ functions such as visual acuity and visual field rather precisely. Accordingly, this chapter uses a numerical assessment of visual functions to derive an estimate of their effect on functional vision (ie, on the ability to perform generic activities of daily living). The process is summarized in Table 12-1.\n\nNote that the prefix visual is used when the score refers to each eye. The prefix functional refers to the estimated performance of the individual. The term vision score combines visual acuity and visual field estimates (and individual adjustments, if significant).\n\n\n12.1 a Steps to Calculate the Visual Impairment Rating\n\n1. Measure visual acuity. Use Table 12-2 to convert each of the measured acuity values to a Visual Acuity Score (VAS).",
  "Section 92 - 3622 chars": "2. Use Table 12-3 to combine the acuity scores from each eye to determine a single Functional Acuity Score (FAS). Note: If the visual fields are normal and no individual corrections are made, the impairment rating for the visual system is equal to the acuity-related impairment rating (100 \u2013 FAS).\n\n3. Measure the visual fields. Use Table 12-5 or the detailed instructions in Section 12.3c to convert each of the measured field values to a Visual Field Score (VFS).\n\n4. Use Table 12-6 to combine the field scores from each eye to determine a single Functional Field Score (FFS).\n\n5. Use the rules in Section 12.4 to combine the Functional Acuity Score and the Functional Field Score to determine a Functional Vision Score (FVS).\n\n6.\nSubtract the Functional Vision Score from 100 to obtain the impairment rating for the visual system.\n\n7. If additional visual impairments are not reflected in the reduction of visual acuity or visual field, the examiner may make an adjustment as explained in Section 12.4. The need for such adjustment must be well documented.\n\nThe procedure as outlined in Table 12-1 reduces a complex reality to a single number. This number ignores individual differences in adjustment to vision loss. This approach can be helpful for administrative and legal purposes because it does not penalize the individual who has made a good adjustment with a reduction of the impairment rating. By the same token, this approach cannot be used for individualized rehabilitation plans. Such plans must be based on an ability profile detailing each of the various skills and abilities of the specific individual. As the rehabilitation proceeds, successful adaptations will reduce further rehabilitation needs. Thus, the ability profile may change while the generic impairment rating will remain the same.\n\n\n12.1 b Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nSubjective symptoms of vision loss usually are the result of objective changes in visual acuity and/or visual field.\n\nVisual acuity describes the ability of the eye to perceive details. Visual acuity loss will manifest itself in an inability to perform detail-oriented tasks, such as reading and face recognition. A lay term for visual acuity loss is blurred vision. Visual acuity loss affects many activities of daily living. Although visual acuity is governed by only a small area of the retina (the fovea, the central-most area), it occupies a major part of the visual cortex.\n\nVisual field refers to the ability to detect objects in the periphery of the visual environment. A lay term for peripheral field loss is tunnel vision. Visual field loss will manifest itself in an inability to detect peripheral objects and, often, in a reduced ability to avoid obstacles. The peripheral visual field occupies the largest part of the retina, but it occupies a smaller part of the visual cortex.\n\nGood visual acuity and good visual field are both needed for the performance of daily living skills. A person with tunnel vision may not notice when someone enters the room. A person with visual acuity loss, on the other hand, may notice the newcomer but may have difficulty recognizing the person\u2019s face. Once an object has been detected in peripheral vision, central vision will be used to recognize it. A person with a visual field defect (ie, tunnel vision) may not notice a sign on the road or on a wall but could read the sign once found, assuming the individual had good visual acuity. A person with normal visual fields but a visual acuity loss will detect the sign but will not be able to read it.",
  "Section 93 - 3068 chars": "Another important function is contrast sensitivity. Whereas visual acuity is generally measured with small objects of high contrast, contrast sensitivity refers to the ability to detect larger objects of poor contrast. This ability is often needed for daily living skills. Facial characteristics are an example of typical low-contrast objects. Contrast sensitivity loss often accompanies visual acuity loss, but it can occur separately. Because measurement methods for contrast sensitivity are not standardized, this function is not included in the impairment ratings. Where indicated, contrast sensitivity loss that exceeds the effects of the visual acuity loss may be handled as an individual adjustment.\n\nOther symptoms may result from deficits in glare sensitivity, color vision, night vision, binocularity, stereopsis, suppression, and diplopia. If these deficits cause a significant ability loss that is not reflected in a visual acuity or a visual field loss, they may also be handled as adjustments to the impairment rating.\n\n\n12.1 c Description of Clinical Studies\nTo obtain the required information, the physician needs to perform a detailed visual assessment, including the cause, severity, and prognosis of the underlying disorder and the expected or documented effects of the vision loss on the ability to perform activities of daily living. Such a visual assessment includes the following.\n\u2022 Medical history, with particular emphasis on preexisting conditions and treatments and on the major cause of the current vision loss.\n\u2022 Current condition of the eyes and visual system, with documentation of relevant anatomic findings.\n\u2022 Visual acuity measurement with best correction, binocularly and for each eye separately. Accurate measurement of distance visual acuity (letter chart acuity) is mandatory; measurement of near acuity (reading acuity) is optional.\n\u2022 Visual field measurement for each eye.\n\u2022 Other visual functions, such as contrast sensitivity or color vision, if considered relevant.\n\u2022 Calculation of an initial impairment rating (visual ability estimate), as detailed in this chapter.\n\u2022 Other factors that may affect the individual\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\u2022 Discussion (with documentation) of factors that might justify an adjustment of the initial ability estimate and discussion of apportionment considerations, if relevant.\n\nIn addition to the equipment needed for a standard ophthalmologic evaluation, the following tools are required for the functional evaluation.\n\u2022 Standardized letter chart. A lighted chart in a lighted room is preferred because it is more representative of normal viewing conditions than is a projector chart in a semidark room. Charts with five letters per line, proportional spacing, and a geometric progression of letter sizes are preferred.5-10 For vision in the normal and nearnormal ranges, testing at 6 m (20 ft) is recommended. For testing in the low-vision range, testing at 1 m is recommended (see Table 12-2). Test charts for this distance are commercially available.24",
  "Section 94 - 3236 chars": "\u2022 Standardized reading tests. Such tests are optional. If performed, they should be standardized tests with continuous text segments as specified in the last section of this chapter. A geometric progression of letter sizes is preferred. Letter size designations should be in M-units24 because the implementation of point size and Jaeger numbers has been shown to be inconsistent from chart to chart.\n\u2022 Visual field equipment. If a restriction of the visual field is claimed or suspected, formal visual field testing on standardized equipment is required. If no visual field restriction is claimed, a confrontation visual field is acceptable to confirm the absence of field restrictions.\n\u2022 Other functional tests, such as a contrast sensitivity test or glare test, if problems in these areas are reported.\n\u2022 Samples of actual job-related tasks, if these tasks are different from average reading tasks.\n\n\n12.2 Impairment of Visual Acuity\n\n12.2 a Visual Acuity Notations\nVisual acuity is usually recorded as a fraction comparing the individual\u2019s performance to a performance standard. If the individual needs letters that are twice as large or twice as close as those needed by a standard eye (ie, 2x angular magnification), the visual acuity is 1/2. If letters are needed that are five times larger or five times closer than those needed by a standard eye, the visual acuity is 1/5, etc. In the United States, it is customary to standardize the numerator at 20. Thus, a visual acuity of 1/2 is recorded as 20/40 and one of 1/5 is recorded as 20/100.\n\n\n12.2 b Test Procedures\nVisual acuity is usually measured with symbols (letters, numbers, pictures, or other symbols) presented in a letter chart format. Because visual acuity values can vary widely, the optimum testing distance is not the same for all groups.\n\n\n12.2b.1 Testing in the Normal Range Individuals in the normal and near-normal range of vision (20/60 or better, ICD-9-CM2, Table 12-2) represent the majority of all patients. The traditional letter charts and projector charts were designed for this group. The most common testing distance is 6 m (20 ft) because at this distance the optical difference with infinity may be ignored. When a printed chart is used, the indicated visual acuity values are valid only if the individual is located at the distance for which the\nchart was designed. If a projector chart is used, the individual must be located at the distance for which the projector was adjusted. Charts with a geometric progression of letter sizes, five letters on each row, and letter spacing that is equal to the letter size (often referred to as ETDRS-type charts) are the preferred standard.9, 10\n\nThe individual is placed at the distance for which the chart was designed and encouraged to read as far down as possible. The line is considered read when more than half of the characters (eg, three of five) are read correctly. Most charts will indicate the visual acuity level that corresponds to the ability to read each line. When visual acuity is measured in this way, the result should be recorded using the standard US notation (ie, 20/\u2026). The individual should be tested with the best available refractive correction.",
  "Section 95 - 3004 chars": "When testing for visual acuities around the 20/200 level (legal blindness), the choice of letter chart is particularly important because it affects the assignment of benefits. On traditional charts that have no lines between 20/100 and 20/200, the descriptor 20/200 or less becomes, effectively, less than 20/100, so individuals with 20/125 would be recorded as 20/200. On newer charts, 20/200 or less is more appropriately interpreted as less than 20/160. If only an older printed chart is available, the individual can be brought to 10 ft so that less than 20/160 can be interpreted as less than 10/80. The individual with 20/125 (10/63) is then reported appropriately as better than 20/200. Note that the term legal blindness is a misnomer because 90% of individuals who have 20/200 or less visual acuity are not blind. The term severe vision loss as used in ICD-9-CM should replace the term legal blindness.\n\n\n12.2b.2 Testing in the Low-Vision Range Use of the Guides will often involve individuals whose visual acuity has dropped to less than 20/60 (ie, to the low-vision range in ICD-9-CM,2 Table 12-2). Individuals in the low-vision range form a\nminority of the general population but may represent the majority of those for whom visual impairment evaluations are requested.\n\nTraditional letter charts often have only a few letters for visual acuities worse than 20/100. Such charts are inadequate for the low-vision range and have promoted the use of vague statements such as \u201ccount fingers\u201d and \u201chand motions.\u201d More accurate results can be obtained by bringing the chart closer. Testing at 1 m is recommended because it can cover the entire low-vision range, down to 1/50 (20/1000).\n\nWhen visual acuity is measured at 1 m, it should be recorded as a metric Snellen fraction in which the numerator records the test distance in meters (in this case 1 m, thus 1/\u2026) and the denominator indicates the smallest letter size read in \u201cM-units\u201d (1 M = 1.45 mm = about 1/16 in). The standard US notation may be added in parentheses. Thus, the ability to read 8 M characters at 1 m should be recorded as 1/8 (20/160). Charts with a cord attached and labeled for 1-m testing are available commercially.24\n\n\n12.2b.3 Correction for Refractive Error\nThe visual acuity without correction may be reported as part of the general eye examination. The impairment ratings should be based on the best-corrected visual acuity. It is important, therefore, to ensure that the refractive correction is appropriate for the testing distance. This is especially true for the short viewing distances used for low-vision individuals. If uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity are the same, this should be stated explicitly.\n\n\n12.2b.4 Monocular vs Binocular Acuity Because binocular viewing represents the most common viewing condition in daily life, the impairment rating should consider the best-corrected binocular visual acuity as well as the best-corrected acuity for each eye separately.",
  "Section 96 - 3415 chars": "Under most circumstances, best-corrected visual acuity measured binocularly will be determined by the acuity of the better eye. There are exceptions, however. People with latent nystagmus may have better eye stability, and hence better acuity, when viewing binocularly than when one eye is occluded. Some people with diplopia or with distortions in one eye may see better when the poorer eye is occluded.\n\n\n12.2b.5 Incomplete Data\nWhenever possible, determination of an impairment rating should be based on direct examination of the individual. Occasionally, it may be necessary to determine a tentative impairment rating based on chart review, where complete data may not be available. If no better information is obtainable, use the following:\nInterpret CF \u2026 ft\nas\n\u2026 /200. Interpret CF \u2026 m\nas\n\u2026 /60. Interpret HM \u2026 ft\nas\n\u2026 /1000. Interpret HM \u2026 m\nas\n\u2026 /300.\nTherefore, CF 3 ft is interpreted as 3/200, and HM 5 ft is interpreted as 5/1000.\n\n\n12.2b.6 Use of Realistic Conditions\nThe evaluation of visual functions should be based on performance under optimal conditions. An exception can be made, however, when the best possible conditions are not feasible in daily life. Examples include individuals who would see better with contact lenses but who cannot tolerate them; those with a large interocular difference in refractive error who cannot tolerate full correction of both eyes; and those who can achieve better acuity with an extremely high or extremely low illumination level that cannot be achieved under daily living conditions or in the workplace.\n\nUnder these and similar conditions, the evaluation should be based on measurements obtained under realistic daily living conditions. Document why testing under suboptimal conditions is most appropriate. When testing multihandicapped individuals, a distinction must be made between failure to see and failure to respond.\n\n\n12.2 c Steps for Assigning a Visual Acuity\u2013Based Impairment Rating\n\n1. Assign a Visual Acuity Score for each eye. Measure visual acuity as outlined above. Use Table 12-2 to replace the visual acuity value with a score value.\n\nThe left part of Table 12-2 lists the ranges of visual acuity loss used in ICD-9-CM.2 At the top of the scale are those with normal vision (20/20 or better), and at the bottom are those who are blind (no light perception). In between are those who have lost part of their vision. This group is said to have low vision (the word vision indicates that they are not blind; the word low indicates that they have less than normal vision). The visual acuity values follow a geometric progression\u2014each line differs from the adjacent lines by a fixed ratio (25%, 10 steps = 10x).\n\nThe central part of Table 12-2 lists impairment ratings. This conversion is based on Weber-Fechner\u2019s law, which states that a proportional increase in the stimulus corresponds to a linear increase in sensation. The Visual Acuity Score (VAS) has fixed increments (5 points) based on counting 1 point for each letter read on a standard acuity chart with 5 letters per line. The VAS is an ability scale on which higher values indicate better function. The impairment rating, which is a scale of ability loss, is obtained by subtracting the VAS from 100. Note that the VAS extends beyond 100 (as does normal visual acuity), but that ability loss is counted only when visual acuity is less than 20/20.",
  "Section 97 - 3157 chars": "The right part of Table 12-2 lists the estimated impact of visual acuity loss on reading ability. These ranges are based on a general ability scale with the following gradations.17\n\nh reserve capacity 80 \u00b1 10\nMild loss\nNormal function, but\n(near-normal)\nloss of reserve\n\nd for some aids 40 \u00b1 10\nSevere loss\nRestricted function,\nslower than normal, even with aids\n\n20 \u00b1 10\nProfound loss\nRestricted function,\nmarginal performance, even with aids\n\n0 \u00b1 10\n(Near-) total loss  Cannot perform;\nneeds substitution skills\n\nThe three parts of Table 12-2 fit well with each other. This confirms that the VAS is a reasonable estimate of acuity-related visual abilities and that the impairment rating is a reasonable estimate of acuity-related performance loss. If no visual acuity data were obtainable, the right side of Table 12-2 might be used to obtain a very rough impairment estimate.\n\n\n2. Combine the acuity values.\nAfter the best-corrected visual acuity values for binocular vision (OU), for the right eye (OD), and for the left eye (OS) have been obtained and converted to Visual Acuity Scores, these values need to be combined to a single Functional Acuity Score (FAS). The FAS provides an estimate of the ability of the person to perform acuity-dependent daily living tasks. This is done using Table 12-3.\n\nNote that VAS and FAS may differ. For example, an individual with one blind eye will have a 0 VAS for that eye. However, if the other eye is normal, the FAS will be near-normal, indicating normal performance but loss of reserves (see Examples 12-2 and 12-14).\n\nThe acuity-related impairment rating (IR) is calculated by subtracting the FAS from 100. Note that the FAS can be larger than 100 but that the impairment rating is truncated at 0.\n\n\n3. Consider reading acuity (optional). Determination of reading acuity (near vision) is optional and is explained in more detail in the last section of this chapter. Reading acuity is typically determined binocularly, but it may be determined monocularly if this gives better results.\n\nIf reading acuity is significantly worse than letter acuity, the functional acuity score may be adjusted to the average of the letter chart (or distance) acuity score and the reading (or near) acuity score. The probable reason for the discrepancy should be explored and explained.\n\nNote: The visual acuity values used in this table follow a strict geometric progression. For clinical use, values such as 20/32 and 20/63 may be rounded to 20/30 and 20/60.\n\n\n12.2d Calculation Examples for Visual Acuity Loss\nNote: In the following examples it is assumed that the visual acuity loss is the only deficit. Visual fields and other visual functions are presumed to be normal.\n\n\n12.3 Impairment of the Visual Field\n\n12.3a Test Procedures\nIf no visual field impairment is claimed or suspected (impairment rating = 0), a confrontation visual field may be used to confirm a normal field. In all other circumstances (impairment rating > 0), formal visual field tests should be performed by qualified personnel according to the instructions provided with the equipment.",
  "Section 98 - 3100 chars": "12.3a.1 Confrontation Visual Field\nThis method uses only the examiner\u2019s hands. Seated in front of the individual, the examiner moves his or her hands from the periphery inward to test for the peripheral field limits. This method is an acceptable way to confirm a normal visual field in individuals in whom no field loss is claimed, but it is too gross for detailed evaluation if a field loss is claimed or suspected.\n\n\n12.3a.2 Tangent Screen Testing\nThis method uses a black screen on which variously sized objects may be moved. This method is difficult to standardize and loses accuracy beyond 45\u00b0. It\nis not acceptable for the accurate assessment of permanent impairment.\n\n\n12.3a.3 Goldmann-Type Testing\nThe Goldmann visual field equipment provided the first standardized measurement technique. Testing is done in a bowl so that all testing distances are equal while the background and stimulus luminances can be controlled tightly. The usual mode of testing is known as kinetic perimetry because a test stimulus of constant size and intensity is moved by an operator.\n\nThe test results are plotted as isopters, contour lines that outline the areas where stimuli of various intensity can be perceived. The functional implications of certain isopter patterns are relatively easy to interpret. Agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, often require testing of the Goldmann III4e isopter for eligibility determinations.\n\n\n12.3a.4 Automated Perimetry\nIn recent decades, there has been a move from manual to automated perimetry. (Commonly used equipment includes Humphrey, Octopus, Dicon, and other brands.) This has been accompanied by a move to static perimetry. In static perimetry, the presentations are limited to various fixed locations where stimulus size and intensity are varied.\n\nAutomated perimetry results are commonly plotted as a gray scale. Such reports are better suited for automated statistical analysis. They are less intuitive for human interpretation with regard to functional vision. Most clinical tests are limited to the central 30\u00b0 because this is the most important area for medical diagnostic purposes. For the functional assessment of visual field loss, however, testing to 60\u00b0 or beyond is mandatory.\n\n\n12.3a.5 Binocular Fields\nConsidering both monocular and binocular function is even more important for a functional assessment of the field of vision than it is for visual acuity because intact field areas in one eye may compensate for field loss in the other eye. In cases of asymmetric field loss, the binocular field of view may be substantially better than the field of view of either eye alone.\n\nDirect testing of the binocular visual field presents problems, however, because the amount of convergence in a bowl perimeter cannot be monitored and fixation monitoring devices will not work when the head, rather than the eye, is centered. Therefore, the fields of each eye should be measured separately, and a binocular field plot should be derived from the superimposition of the two monocular field plots.",
  "Section 99 - 3028 chars": "12.3a.6 Tests Used\nWhen Goldmann equipment is used, the III4e isopter should be plotted. If only a larger isopter is available, this isopter may be used (this may result in an underestimation of the field loss). If only smaller isopters are available, the test cannot be used for impairment evaluation.\n\nIf automated equipment is used, a pseudoisopter equivalent to the Goldmann III4e isopter should be constructed (see Example 12-9). On the Humphrey equipment, this would be the isopter for a 10-dB stimulus. Plots of the central 30\u00b0 may only be used when the remaining field radius is smaller than 20\u00b0 and confrontation testing indicates no further peripheral vision.\n\n\n12.3b The Visual Field Score (VFS)\nThe Visual Field Score (VFS), which is the basis for the calculation of visual field\u2013based impairment ratings, parallels the Visual Acuity Score (VAS). The VAS can be determined by counting the letters read correctly on a standardized visual acuity chart.\nSimilarly, the VFS can be determined by counting the points seen on a standardized visual field grid. The combination rules are also similar.\n\n\n12.3b.1 Testing Grid\nThe testing grid is constructed by drawing 10 meridians: 2 in each of the upper quadrants and 3 in each of the lower quadrants. The optimal positions for the 10 meridians are as follows: 25\u00b0, 65\u00b0 (upper right), 115\u00b0, 155\u00b0 (upper left), 195\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 255\u00b0 (lower left),\n\n285\u00b0, 315\u00b0, and 345\u00b0 (lower right). Along these meridians, 5 points (spaced 2\u00b0 apart) are assigned to the central 10\u00b0 and 5 points (spaced 10\u00b0 apart) are assigned to the periphery beyond 10\u00b0; thus, a 60\u00b0 radius will represent 10 points. The nasal and superior meridians may not reach 60\u00b0, but the lateral field will extend further. Thus, the average normal field will score about 100 points.\n\nFigure 12-1 summarizes the point assignments. The circle represents a 10\u00b0 radius.\n\nThis arrangement has the following effects:\n\u2022 The visual field score for the central 10\u00b0 is 50 points. This reflects that the central 10\u00b0 of the visual field correspond to 50% of the primary visual cortex. This also maintains the traditional assumption that a visual field loss to a 10\u00b0 radius is equally disabling as a visual acuity loss to 20/200.\n\u2022 Choosing the measured meridians within the quadrants rather than along the horizontal and vertical meridians avoids the need for special rules for hemianopias.\n\u2022 A complete homonymous hemianopia receives a 50-point score. This implies that it is considered equally disabling as a field restriction to a 10\u00b0 radius or as a visual acuity loss to 20/200.\n\u2022 Choosing 3 meridians in the lower quadrants and 2 in the upper ones acknowledges the functional importance of the lower field by giving it 50% extra weight.\n\u2022 ICD-9-CM defines severe, profound, and neartotal visual field loss as concentric restriction to a 10\u00b0, 5\u00b0, and 2.5\u00b0 field radius.2 These categories fit the VFS scale.\n\nThe VFS is summarized in Table 12-5, which is similar to Table 12-2 in organization.",
  "Section 100 - 3097 chars": "Use Table 12-5 or the detailed rules in Section 12.3c to determine a Visual Field Score for each eye.\nProceed to Table 12-6 to combine the scores from each eye to determine a single Functional Field Score.\n\n\n12.3c Assigning a Field-Based Impairment Rating\nCalculation of a visual field\u2013based impairment rating requires the following steps.\n\n\n1. Determine the extent of the visual field for each eye. If Goldmann visual field plots are available, determine the III4e isopter for each eye. If only automated visual field plots are available, determine a pseudoisopter by drawing a line surrounding all points with a sensitivity of 10 dB or better, excluding points with < 10-dB sensitivity. If automated field plots are used, these should be full-field plots (Humphrey 60-2 or the equivalent). The 30\u00b0 plot may be used only if confrontation testing has determined that there are no peripheral islands of vision and if a 30\u00b0 central field plot (Humphrey 30-2 or the equivalent) shows that there is no vision beyond 20\u00b0.\n\n2.\nDetermine the Visual Field Score for each eye. Use the pattern explained in Figure 12-1. This pattern can be implemented in several ways, explained below.\n\n\n2.a. Paper and pencil\nStarting with a visual field plot of the III4e isopter (or the equivalent), draw 10 meridians, 2 in each upper quadrant and 3 in each lower quadrant. To space the meridians evenly, use the following approximate positions: 25\u00b0, 65\u00b0 (upper right), 115\u00b0,\n\n155\u00b0 (upper left), 195\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 255\u00b0 (lower left), 285\u00b0,\n\n315\u00b0, and 345\u00b0 (lower right).\n\nDetermine the extent of each meridian. Within 10\u00b0 from fixation, round to the nearest 2\u00b0 value; outside 10\u00b0 round to the nearest 10\u00b0 value. Convert the rounded extent to a subscore using Table 12-8.\n\nIf a scotoma interrupts the meridian, round the extent of the scotoma to the nearest 2\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 value and subtract the corresponding point value. In the presence of scotomata, use of the overlay grid is the preferred method.\n\nAdd the 10 subscores to obtain the VFS for that eye. The average normal field will score about 100 points.\n\n\n2.b. Overlay grid\nCreate an overlay grid with 10 meridians (see step 2.a) and grid points on each meridian at 1\u00b0, 3\u00b0, 5\u00b0, 7\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 25\u00b0, 35\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 55\u00b0, and 65\u00b0. Place the\noverlay grid over the field plot. Count the grid points enclosed by the III4e isopter (or the equivalent). Grid points within scotomata should not be counted. The total number of points seen is the Visual Field Score (VFS).\n\n\n2.c. Automated calculation\nA pilot study in 1992 conducted with a Humphrey Field Analyzer and controlled by an IBM-PC has shown the feasibility of a fully automated test sequence using the points of the overlay grid as stimulus positions.16 Such a program is not yet available commercially.\n\n\n3. Determine the Functional Field Score (FFS). Determine the binocular field by superimposing the monocular fields. For the binocular field, points are counted as seen if seen by both eyes or by one of the eyes. This determines the binocular VFS.",
  "Section 101 - 3023 chars": "Combine the Visual Field Scores for OU, OD, and OS (see Table 12-6):\n\n12.3\nd Calculation Examples for Visual Field Loss\nThe following examples calculate the Visual Field Score for a single eye. This calculation needs to be followed by the same calculation for the other eye and for the binocular field (see Examples12-10 and\n\n12-11). Finally, use Table 12-6 to combine these values to determine a Functional Field Score.\n\nMethod 2: Create an overlay grid (see instructions in Section 12.3c).\nCount the points within the III4e isopter. The diagram has 100 solid dots within the 60\u00b0 circle and 8 open dots outside. The score is easily counted as: 100 \u2013 solid dots missed (symbol ?) + open dots seen (symbol heavy ). For this field plot: FFS = 100 \u2013 4 + 4 = 100.\nComment: The Visual Field Score is 100; therefore, the impairment rating is 0%. Note that the extra points seen laterally compensate for the points missed nasally and superiorly.\n\n\n12.3e Calculating the Binocular Field Existing perimeters are not equipped to provide reliable measurements of the binocular visual field.\nTherefore, the binocular visual field is constructed by superimposing the two monocular plots. On the superimposed plot, areas seen by either eye are counted as seen; only areas not seen by either eye are counted as defects. The resulting binocular score can vary dramatically, depending on the location of the defects.\n\n\n12.4 Impairment of the Visual System\nThe preceding calculations have provided us with two separate impairment estimates. The FAS provides an estimate for visual acuity\u2013related abilities, such as reading, while the FFS provides an estimate for visual field\u2013related abilities, such as orientation and mobility. To obtain an overall estimate of visual impairment, the two impairment estimates must be combined to a single Functional Vision Score (FVS). Subtracting the FVS from 100 then provides the visual impairment rating for the visual system.\nSee below (Section 12.4c, Table 12-10) for the whole person impairment rating.\n\nBecause the calculations outlined so far consider only the visual acuity and visual field aspects of vision, there must be room for individual adjustments in cases where functional vision is limited by factors other than visual acuity and visual field. The procedure was summarized in Table 12-1.\n\n\n12.4a Calculating an Impairment Rating for the Visual System\nThe FAS and the FFS were calculated as weighted averages. This is appropriate because a good visual acuity or good visual field in one eye can compensate for loss of the same function in the other eye. Visual acuity\u2013related functions and visual field\u2013related functions, however, are largely independent. Good visual acuity cannot compensate for a loss of visual field, and vice versa. Therefore, the FAS and the FFS are combined using a multiplication formula.\n\n\n12.4a.1 Basic Rule\nTo calculate the FVS, the FAS and the FFS are multiplied as if they represented percentage scores:",
  "Section 102 - 3008 chars": "FVS = (FAS ? FFS)/100\nFor example, if the FAS is 80 (a 20% impairment) and the FFS is 75 (a 25% impairment), the FVS is calculated as: 80% ? 75% = 60% (a 40% impairment).\n\nNote that this calculation can be performed only on the basis of the residual ability scores. Adding or multiplying the impairment ratings (which indicate ability loss) gives erroneous answers.\n\n\n12.4a.2 Additional Rules\nSome additional rules are needed to avoid unrealistic calculations.\n\n1. For the purpose of this calculation, Functional Acuity and Functional Field Scores that are > 100 are treated as if they were 100. Thus, losses are counted only if the performance drops below the performance standard. The average performance of healthy eyes often is better than the performance standard. This better performance is taken into account in calculating the Functional Scores (see Example 12-2), but it is not counted as a reduction of the impairment rating.\n\n2. If visual field data are not available and if there is no clinical reason to suspect visual field loss, the FFS may be assumed to be 100. In this case, the FVS is the same as the FAS, and the impairment rating for the visual system is the same as the impairment rating for the visual acuity loss.\n\n\n12.4a.3 Rule for Central Scotomata (Field Loss and Acuity Loss Are Not Independent) The dense array of points in the central 10\u00b0 area of the visual field grid means that paracentral scotomata (blind spots adjacent to the point of fixation) will be counted even if they do not affect the central acuity. This is appropriate because it has been shown that such scotomata can interfere significantly with reading ability and with other activities of daily living.\n\nHowever, if the scotoma is central (ie, it covers the point of fixation), it affects both visual acuity and visual field and the two impairment ratings can no longer be treated as independent. Using the basic formula, central scotomata would be counted twice: once through their effect on visual acuity and once through their effect on the central field. Therefore, an additional rule is needed.\n\n\n3. If visual acuity is reduced, some central visual field losses will not be counted, as specified in Table 12-9.\n\nThus, for every 10 points of VAS loss, field losses in one ring of 10 grid points are ignored. This means that these points are counted as if they were seen.\nThis adjustment is made for each eye separately. The effect of this rule is that individuals with a small island of good acuity within a pericentral scotoma will get credit for this scotoma, but that those with a central scotoma that affects visual acuity will not get double benefits. The adjustment does not affect peripheral field losses. Thus, a person with peripheral field loss due to glaucoma who also develops a\n\ncentral loss due to macular degeneration will get credit for the central loss as well as for the peripheral field loss (see Examples 12-13, 12-14, and 12-15).\n\n",
  "Section 103 - 3220 chars": "12.4b Individual Adjustments\nAlthough visual acuity loss and visual field loss represent significant aspects of visual impairment, they are not the only factors that can lead to a loss of functional vision. This edition of the Guides does not provide detailed scales for other functions, such as:\n\n\u2022 Contrast sensitivity. This is the ability to perceive larger objects of poor contrast. Loss of this ability can interfere significantly with many activities of daily living. It is often, but not always, associated with a loss of visual acuity.\n\u2022 Glare sensitivity (veiling glare), delayed glare recovery, photophobia (light sensitivity), and reduced or delayed light and dark adaptation. These are other functions that may interfere with proper contrast perception.\n\u2022 Color vision defects. These defects are not uncommon but usually do not interfere significantly with generic activities of daily living. Severe color vision defects (achromatopsia) are usually accompanied by visual acuity loss. In some vocational settings the impact of minor color vision deficiencies can be significant. This could be a case where the generic impairment rating does not reflect the job-specific employability rating.\n\u2022 Binocularity, stereopsis, suppression, and diplopia. These functions vary in their effect on activities of daily living. Their significance often depends on the environment and on vocational demands.\n\nStandardized measurement techniques on which standardized ability estimates can be based have not yet been developed for most of these functions.\nFurthermore, their effect may be partially accounted for by a loss of visual acuity and may vary significantly according to environmental demands.\n\nIf significant factors remain that affect functional vision and that are not accounted for through visual acuity or visual field loss, a further adjustment of the impairment rating of the visual system may be in order. The need for the adjustment, however, must be well documented. The adjustment should be limited to an increase in the impairment rating of the visual system (reduction of the FVS) by, at most, 15 points.\n\nThe same rule should be observed as in the case of central scotomata: Deficits should only be counted to the extent that their effect exceeds the effect of the related visual acuity or visual field deficit. Note the following examples.\n\n1. An individual with a congenital dark adaptation deficit with normal acuity and normal fields may be given a limited impairment rating based on this deficit. In someone with rod dystrophy (RP) manifested by field loss as well as dark adaptation problems, the impairment rating will be determined by the field loss and no additional rating is given for the dark adaptation deficit.\n\n2. Most people with visual acuity loss due to macular degeneration also have a loss of contrast sensitivity. Because the impairment rating is dominated by the visual acuity loss, no additional rating is given for the contrast sensitivity loss. Occasionally, individuals will have a bothersome contrast sensitivity loss while the visual acuity is still normal. In these cases, a limited impairment rating may be given based on the contrast sensitivity loss.",
  "Section 104 - 3363 chars": "3. Minor color vision deficits exist in about 5% of males. These deficits do not interfere with generic activities of daily living and do not receive an impairment rating. A printer with such a deficit would have no problems with black-and-white printing, but he or she may have difficulty judging the accuracy of color prints. This is a deficit that affects employability in a specific job, but it does not enter into the generic impairment considerations in this chapter (see Chapters 1 and 2). Total color blindness (achromatopsia) is extremely rare. It is accompanied by visual acuity loss, in which case the visual acuity loss will determine the impairment rating.\n\n\n12.4c Impairment of the Whole Person In classes 1, 2, and 3, individuals may benefit from vision enhancement techniques such as large print,\nbetter illumination, and better contrast. In classes 4, 5, and 6, a shift to vision substitution techniques occurs; this may include talking books, Braille, long cane, etc. Because of these techniques, a totally blind person is not totally incapacitated. In the previous section, a downward adjustment of the Functional Vision Score of up to 15 points was allowed for additional impairments whose effect exceeds that of the visual acuity and/or visual field loss. A similar, but opposite, adjustment may be made in classes 4, 5, and 6 to account for the effects of vision substitution skills that alleviate the effects of the permanent vision loss.\n\nThis adjustment affects the translation of the impairment rating of the visual system to an impairment rating of the whole person as shown in Table 12-10. Since the effectiveness of vision substitution skills will vary from person to person and cannot be predicted from the visual acuity and visual field measurements, the adjustments in Table 12-10 are generalized estimates.\n\nThat the whole person impairment rating is not reduced further, even for blind persons who have made very effective adjustments, reflects the fact that vision substitution skills alleviate the effects of vision loss but do not eliminate the vision loss itself.\n\n\n12.4 d Calculation Examples Combining Visual Acuity Loss and Visual Field Loss\n\nDiagnosis: History of retinoblastoma.\nImpairment Rating: 100 \u2013 84 = 16% impairment of the visual system, which is also the impairment of the whole person (see Table 12-10).\nComment: The loss of one eye reduces the Functional Vision Score to the near-normal range, indicating a significant loss of reserves but not a significant restriction of the ability to perform activities of daily living.\nNote: To simplify the presentation of the following cases, the assumption is made that both eyes have identical conditions so that the Functional Acuity and Field Scores equal the Visual Acuity and Field Scores of the eye that is discussed. In real cases there usually will be differences in the scores.\n\n\n12.5 Visual Acuity Measurement at Near (Reading Acuity)\nConsideration of reading acuity in the calculation of the FAS is optional. It is warranted only if the reading acuity is significantly different from the distance acuity. In that case, it is appropriate to use the average of the FAS for letter chart acuity and the FAS for reading as indicated in Table 12-11. This section contains instructions for accurate reading acuity measurement.",
  "Section 105 - 3020 chars": "12.5 a Near Acuity vs Distance Acuity (Reading Acuity vs Letter Chart Acuity) Near acuity may be measured with a reduced-size letter chart or with continuous text. When the objective is the assessment of functional vision\u2014as is the purpose of the Guides\u2014continuous textual reading material should be used.\n\nUnder most circumstances, letter chart acuity and reading acuity\u2014if measured appropriately and with the proper refractive correction\u2014will be similar.\nIf significant differences between reading acuity and letter chart acuity exist, measurement errors,\ninappropriate refractive correction, and/or other complicating factors should first be suspected. The nature of these factors needs to be explored, documented, and corrected where possible. Accurate calculation of the reading acuity requires accurate measurement of the letter size as well as the viewing distance. Many practitioners record only the letter size read and not the reading distance. Table 12-11 shows that this is inappropriate because small changes in the reading distance can result in significant changes in visual acuity, especially if the reading distance is short.\n\nOne cause of a true discrepancy between reading acuity and letter chart acuity might be that the individual uses a small central island within a ring scotoma for letter acuity while using a larger, more eccentric area for reading. Another cause might be that when measuring letter chart acuity, people are usually pushed for threshold or marginal performance, whereas reading tests more often aim at a level of comfortable performance. For this reason, the magnification requirement for reading acuity may be somewhat greater than that for letter acuity. The difference is known as the magnification reserve needed for reading fluency.\n\n\n12.5b Letter Size Notations\nAnother reason for discrepancies can be found in the use of inaccurate letter size notations. The commonly used Jaeger numbers refer to the labels on the boxes in the printing house in Vienna where Jaeger selected his print samples. They have no numerical value, and their implementation on various reading cards is notoriously variable. The J-numbers listed in Table 12-11 present the range of J-designations found for each letter size when a number of reading cards were surveyed.\n\nSome charts use a notation in printer\u2019s points. Point sizes have a numerical value but may vary depending on the type style used. Many reading cards list distance equivalents. This notation is valid only if the card is used at the distance for which the card was designed. At any other distance, the use of distance equivalents is utterly confusing.\n\nThe only letter size unit that allows a comparison between letter chart acuity and reading acuity is the M-unit. M-units refer directly to the actual letter size (X-height for uppercase letters on a letter chart, xheight for lowercase letters in a reading segment).\nOne M-unit subtends 5 minutes of arc at 1 m and equals 1.454 mm (10% less than 1/16 in).",
  "Section 106 - 3128 chars": "12.5c Measurement Guidelines for Reading Acuity (Near-Vision Acuity) Visual acuity measurement at near is more complex than visual acuity measurement at distance because\nboth letter size and viewing distance can vary. When reading acuity is measured, follow these guidelines.\nIf binocular reading is possible, the binocular reading acuity should be recorded. If binocular reading is not possible or not preferred, the reading acuity of the eye that is preferred for actual reading should be\n\n\n1/16 in. Measuring the letter size in units of 1/16 in overestimates the visual acuity by slightly less than half a standard step size.\n\nTo test reading acuity for the normal and near-normal range, many cards are available. Most will indicate distance equivalents. Note that these distance equivalents are valid only if the designated distance is used.\n\nMany individuals undergoing impairment evaluation will fall in the low-vision range. They may require shorter reading distances and/or larger print sizes.\nTable 12-11 shows the proper visual acuity values and impairment ratings for many combinations of letter size and viewing distance.\n\n\n12.5d Modified Snellen Formula\nThe visual acuity values found in Table 12-11 could be calculated using the standard Snellen fraction V = m/M, in which the viewing distance is specified in meters (1 m = 100 cm = 40 in, 1 in = 2.5 cm) and the letter size is in M-units. Use of the standard Snellen fraction becomes awkward when the viewing distance (in meters) is itself a fraction. In this case, it is more convenient to use the reciprocal of the viewing distance, which is known as the diopter (2 diopters = 1/2 m, 5 D = 1/5 m, etc). The use of reciprocal values turns the Snellen fraction into a multiplication, which is more easily calculated in one\u2019s head because it uses whole numbers instead of fractions within fractions.\n\nThe traditional formula\n\nused.\n\nThe measurement of reading acuity requires a reading card with calibrated reading segments. Cards with proportionally spaced segments of equal length are preferred. The preferred step size is the same as for letter charts. The viewing distance should be measured and recorded carefully. Measurement with a diopter ruler simplifies calculations (see Section 12.5d) and provides a direct comparison to the required accommodation or reading add. Letter size specification in M-units is mandatory if any calculations or comparisons are involved. One M-unit equals 1.454 mm, which is slightly smaller than\n\nwhere M = letter size in M-units, m = viewing distance in meters, and D = viewing distance in diopters.\n\n\n12.5e Instructions\nTo find the optimal combination of reading distance and letter size, start at the reading distance that corresponds to the individual\u2019s current reading add and/or accommodative power. Increase the reading add (reduce the reading distance) to reach smaller print. Using Table 12-11, find the visual acuity at the intersection of the letter size row and the reading distance column. Alternatively, using the M ? D formula and a diopter ruler, calculate the 1/V value.",
  "Section 107 - 3242 chars": "For each combination of viewing distance and letter size read, compare the reading add to the viewing distance in diopters to verify the appropriate refractive correction. Also, compare the M ? D value to verify that the visual acuity values are consistent.\n\n\n12.5f Correction of Refractive Error\nTo verify that the refractive correction is appropriate for the viewing distance, it is often useful to ask the individual to move the card back and forth to find the best possible focus. If the refractive correction (reading add) is not optimal, the measured acuity will not be the best-corrected visual acuity. Measuring the reading distance in diopters has the advantage of easy comparison to the reading addition.\n\nChapter 13:\nThe Central and Peripheral Nervous System\n13.1 Principles of Assessment\n13.2 Criteria for Rating Impairments Due to Central Nervous System Disorders\n13.3 Criteria for Rating Cerebral Impairments\n13.4 Criteria for Rating Impairments of the Cranial Nerves\n13.5 Criteria for Rating Impairments of Station, Gait, and Movement Disorders\n13.6 Criteria for Rating Impairments of Upper Extremities Related to Central Impairment\n13.7 Criteria for Rating Spinal Cord and Related Impairments\n13.8 Criteria for Rating Impairments Related to Chronic Pain\n13.9 Criteria for Rating Impairments of the Peripheral Nervous System, Neuromuscular Junction, and Muscular System\n13.10 Nervous System Impairment Evaluation Summary\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides criteria for evaluating permanent impairments due to documented dysfunction of the brain, cranial nerves, spinal cord, nerve roots, and/or peripheral nerves and muscles.\n\nThe following revisions have been made for the fifth edition: (1) an impairment evaluation summary is provided at the end of the chapter to allow easy access to the neurologic impairment in question; (2) a description of ancillary tests with some of their indications provides an understanding of abnormalities found on the neurologic examination; (3) there is more guidance in the assessment of cognition, gait and movement disorders, and cranial nerve disorders; and (4) additional cases are included to illustrate each area of impairment.\n\n\n13.1 Principles of Assessment\nThis chapter emphasizes the deficits or impairments that may be identified during a neurologic evaluation.\nFor some nervous system impairments listed, hand dominance is critical to determine the degree of impairment. To evaluate distal nerve traumatic injury, refer to Chapter 16, The Upper Extremities. Because neurologic impairments are intimately related to mental and emotional processes and their functioning, the examiner should also understand Chapters 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders, and 18, Pain (pain has been accounted for in neurologic-based impairment ratings). Additional impairments based on those chapters may need to be considered.\n\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluations.",
  "Section 108 - 3493 chars": "A permanent neurologic impairment is any anatomic, physiological, or functional abnormality or loss that remains after maximum medical improvement (MMI). Impairment rating criteria for neurologic impairments include an assessment of the ability\nto perform activities of daily living, as listed in Table 1-2. These limitations may involve physical performance (eg, walking, climbing, lifting, finger dexterity) or mental performance (eg, cognition\nor communication).\n\nIf impairments involve several nervous system areas (eg, the brain, spinal cord, and/or peripheral nerves), calculate separate whole person impairment ratings for each area and combine them using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). As discussed in the following text, impairment of the brain is assessed differently. Because brain dysfunction will likely affect many overlapping functions, identify the most severe cerebral impairment. The impairment rating is based on the neurologic condition that causes the most severe impairment. Examples are provided later in the chapter.\n\n\n13.1 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nNervous system disorders can present with generalized or focal symptoms. Symptoms may include alterations in level of consciousness, confusion, memory loss, difficulties with language, headache, visual blurring, double vision, fatigue, facial pain and weakness, ringing in the ears, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty swallowing or speaking, weakness of one or multiple limbs, difficulty walking or climbing\n\nstairs, shooting pain, numbness and tingling in the extremities, tremor, loss of coordination, loss of bladder or rectal control, and sexual dysfunction. Note that many of these symptoms describe the functional impairment experienced by the individual. The neurologic evaluation and ancillary clinical testing determine the origin of these symptoms. Difficulty walking, for example, may result from problems in different areas of the central and/or peripheral nervous system. The neurologic examination may find a spastic paraparesis associated with a spinal cord lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine may show the etiology to be demyelinating plaques that also may show abnormal somatosensory evoked response since the pathway travels through the areas of demyelination in the spinal cord.\n\nSome impairment classes refer directly to limitations in the ability to perform activities of daily living because of symptoms. When this information is subjective and open to misinterpretation, it should not serve as the sole criterion upon which decisions about impairment are made. Rather, obtain objective data about the severity of the findings and the limitations and integrate those findings with the subjective data to estimate the degree of permanent impairment.\n\n\n13.1b Description of Clinical Studies:\nA detailed neurologic examination enables the physician to identify the location of nervous system impairment. The purpose of ancillary testing is to assess the severity and location of the lesion and confirm the underlying pathology. It is important to remember that an abnormality found on ancillary testing (anatomic or physiologic) is an impairment but is not necessarily assigned an impairment rating if functions needed for activities of daily living are not affected. The nervous system is able to compensate for a variety of lesions due to its plasticity and redundancy, sometimes resulting in limited representation on the neurologic examination.",
  "Section 109 - 3165 chars": "Common clinical studies for the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) include those described below.\n\nNeuropsychologic assessment can characterize cognitive and behavioral alterations and therefore is useful in the clinical assessment and planning of patient management. The results of this assessment must be interpreted in the context of clinical and other test information. Many factors affect neuropsychological performance\u2014age, education, socioeconomic status, and cultural background\u2014and they must therefore be\n\nconsidered for their influence on test results. Neuropsychological tests may be able to distinguish between abnormal and normal performance but cannot determine the cause of the problem. In other words, neuropsychological testing cannot demonstrate consistent diagnostic validity. Traumatic brain injury, for example, may have a profile similar to that of other forms of dementia.\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap) is a procedure by which cerebrospinal fluid is removed through a medium-sized needle, usually at the L3-4 interspace, in order to examine the presence of cells, proteins, glucose, or infection. This test may be performed when evaluating peripheral nerve disease. Other indications are infections of the nervous system and, sometimes, multiple sclerosis.\n\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) records the spontaneous electrical activity generated by the cerebral cortex and is useful for recording the site and type of electrical discharge associated with seizure activity. Remember that a large percentage of cortical spikes are not recorded because they arise from deeper structures and there is significant attenuation by the cerebrospinal fluid and dura. Therefore, a seizure disorder is not necessarily accompanied by an abnormal EEG. Also, many diseases and metabolic abnormalities produce nonspecific EEG abnormalities.\nThe EEG may be normal when the neurologic examination is clearly abnormal since many areas of the brain are inaccessible to the recording electrodes and the EEG is time specific, ie, normal between discharges.\n\nEvoked potentials are able to record components of response in the nervous system following multiple somatosensory, visual, and auditory stimuli. The integrity of these afferent pathways is evaluated. These studies may be used in the clinical evaluation of multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and acoustic neuroma.\nAlso, a variety of neurotoxins (eg, solvents, heavy metals) may produce alterations in the evoked potentials.\n\nCarotid duplex examination includes Doppler flow velocity of different areas in the carotid artery and, thus, estimates the severity of stenosis in the carotid artery. It is performed in the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease.\n\nComputed tomographic (CT) scan shows the anatomy of the brain, spinal cord, skull, and vertebral column. X-ray beams are used to differentiate densities of bone-calcified tissue, gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and air. Intravenous\n\ncontrast demonstrates areas where the blood-brain barrier is disrupted. CT scans are not ideal for examination of soft tissue but are better used to detect fresh hemorrhage or bone lesions.",
  "Section 110 - 3315 chars": "CT myelogram uses a CT scan, after contrast material is injected into the dural sac, to show alterations in the anatomy between the dural sac and the structures that surround it. Since this is an invasive technique,\nit may be used for diagnostic aid or preoperative planning.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a powerful magnetic field to align the protons of the tissue that are excited by a radio frequency, subsequently forming an image from the different intensities of radio waves emitted from the different tissues. T1weighted images show soft tissue anatomy, while T2-weighted images demonstrate edema and cerebrospinal fluid. Contrast agents enhance lesions\nwhen there is disruption in the blood-brain barrier. A variety of MRI techniques enhance the ability to see different types of pathology.\n\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) allows vessel visualization with images of different intensities that reflect velocity and flow patterns. Basically, visualization of vessels reflects physical differences between moving and stationary protons.\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) allows examination of cerebral function by tomographic images.\nBecause of the complexity, cost, and limitation of isotopes with short half-lives, most studies at present are limited to research protocols, although clinical studies are available to document, in some individuals, the presence of Parkinson\u2019s disease in its early stages.\n\nSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) assesses brain perfusion by use of tracers. Since there is a strong relationship between local metabolism and blood flow, SPECT provides indirect information about metabolism. Therefore, it may show abnormalities in dementia and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nThe peripheral nervous system can be evaluated by means of the following tests.\n\nNerve conduction and needle electromyography (EMG) studies help to determine which nerves are involved and their anatomic location. Also evident will be whether sensory, motor, or both fibers are predominantly involved and whether axonal degeneration, deymelination, or a combination of both is\n\npresent. Skillful differentiation of peripheral neuropathy and neuromuscular disorders may also be possible. Expert neuromuscular knowledge and understanding of pathologic manifestations of disease processes are necessary for the appropriate application and performance of these tests, particularly the EMG. These tests are objective and require minimal cooperation from the individual being tested. They reflect pathology in the largest, fastestconducting nerve fibers. The interpretation of these tests must be correlated with a detailed neurologic evaluation.\n\nQuantitative sensory tests are portable tests, easily conducted in the clinician\u2019s office, that provide a quantitative assessment of sensation. The integrity of large myelinated fibers is monitored with vibration threshold. Warm and cold temperature thresholds assess medium myelinated and unmyelinated fibers not reflected in nerve conduction studies. Since these are psychophysical tests, the cooperation of the individual being tested is required to process information from cutaneous receptors and provide the appropriate response. These tests can provide information about nerve fibers not examined by nerve conduction studies.",
  "Section 111 - 3011 chars": "Autonomic function assessment is performed when cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, sphincter, and/or sexual dysfunction is believed to be caused by dysautonomia. For example, postural hypotension tests would include measuring heart rate and blood pressure response to the Valsalva maneuver and heart rate response to deep breathing, postural change, and stress. The integrity of both the central and efferent autonomic pathways is examined with these studies. Sweating abnormalities can be documented by warming the individual and then applying a powder that changes color when wet.\n\n\n13.2 Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Central Nervous System Disorders\nThe central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord. When injury or illness affects the CNS, several areas of function may be impaired. Therefore, the most severe category of impairment is based on the neurologic evaluation and relevant clinical investigations in four categories: (1) state of consciousness and level of awareness, whether\n\npermanent or episodic; (2) mental status evaluation and integrative functioning; (3) use and understanding of language; and (4) influence of behavior and mood. The motor and sensory systems, gait, and coordination are evaluated once the four categories of cerebral impairment have been determined.\n\nThe most severe of these four categories should be used to determine a cerebral impairment rating.\n\nStep 1. The initial step in assessing cerebral function is to determine whether disturbance is present in the level of consciousness or awareness. This may be a permanent alteration or an intermittent alteration in consciousness, awareness, or arousal. See Table 13-2 (Criteria for Rating Impairment of Consciousness and Awareness); Table 13-3 (Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Episodic Loss of Consciousness or Awareness); and Table 13-4 (Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Sleep and Arousal Disorders).\nStep 2. Evaluate mental status and highest integrative functioning (see Table 13-6, Criteria for Rating Impairment Related to Mental Status).\nStep 3. Identify any difficulty with understanding and use of language (see Table 13-7, Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Aphasia or Dysphasia).\nStep 4. Evaluate any emotional or behavioral disturbances, such as depression, that can modify cerebral function (see Table 13-8, Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Emotional or Behavioral Disorders).\nStep 5. Identify the most severe cerebral impairment listed above. Combine the most severe impairment from catagories 1 through 4 with any or multiple distinct neurologic impairments listed in Table 13-1 using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\n\n13.3 Criteria for Rating Cerebral Impairments\n\n13.3a Disturbances in Level of Consciousness and/or Awareness Individuals experiencing disturbances in consciousness may be suffering from a range of symptoms from episodes of altered awareness to being in a persistent vegetative state or an unresponsive coma.",
  "Section 112 - 3101 chars": "These conditions are evaluated based on clinical findings on the neurologic examination and ancillary testing such as CT scan, MRI, SPECT, EEG, evoked potentials, and vestibular testing. The examination and tests will provide the extent of the underlying pathology and help examiners form a prognosis for patient management.\n\nThese neurologic disturbances may result in global loss of consciousness, responsiveness, or focal or lateral neurologic impairments. Table 13-2 lists criteria for determining permanent impairment ratings in individuals with these conditions, considering the severity of their condition and their ability to perform activities of daily living. For a class 1 rating, the individual is expected to perform activities of daily living (ADL) independently but may need assistance with activities that require fine motor dexterity (eg, buttoning). Class 2 impairment, in which individuals are moderately limited in ability to perform ADL, indicates the preservation of some independence but a need for assistance with transfers, bathing, and activities that require fine motor skills. Impairment classes 3 and 4 are assigned to individuals who require assistance in performing all ADL; different levels of participation by the individual differentiate the level of care required in the two classes.\n\n\n13.3b Episodic Neurologic Impairments The Guides rates episodic neurologic impairments that are persistent and permanent. Episodic conditions involve syncope or loss of awareness, convulsive disorders, and arousal and sleep disorders.\nEpisodic indicates more than one occurrence. When these conditions originate from a problem in the nervous system, they should be evaluated according to the guidelines given in this chapter. For similar manifestations that originate in other body systems (eg, cardiovascular, respiratory) and secondarily affect the central nervous system, see the chapter(s) for the originating body system(s).\n\nIn assessing permanent impairment due to episodic conditions, first ensure that the individual\u2019s condition has reached MMI and is unlikely to change significantly. Document the pattern of occurrence, estimate the effect of the condition on the individual\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living, and evaluate the effects of appropriate treatment. Record results from appropriate physiologic evaluations (eg, ECG, cardiologic evaluations, EEG) to document the disorder\u2019s severity and provide information about prognosis.\n\nDescribe episodic disorders according to their onset, frequency, duration, and effect on performance of daily activities. Document and describe the results of seizure control. Daytime loss of consciousness with tonic or clonic seizures, nocturnal episodes with daytime residua, or brief lapses of awareness/communication from minor seizures may interfere significantly with daily activities. Minor seizures with alterations of awareness or consciousness, transient manifestations of unconventional behavior, or interruptions of daytime activity can result in an inability to perform activities of daily living.",

Examiners may need to refer to other Guides chapters to estimate the magnitude of impairments related to cardiovascular disorders.\n\nThe criteria for evaluating episodic loss of consciousness or awareness are given in Table 13-3.\n\n\n13.3c Arousal and Sleep Disorders\nArousal and sleep disorders include disorders related to initiating and maintaining sleep or inability to sleep; excessive somnolence, including sleep-induced respiratory impairment; and sleep-wake schedules.\n\nImpairment categories that may arise from sleep disorders relate to (1) the nervous system, with reduced daytime attention, concentration, and other cognitive abilities; (2) mental and behavioral factors, including depression, irritability, interpersonal difficulties, and\n\nsocial problems; (3) the cardiovascular system, with systemic and pulmonary hypertension, cardiac enlargement, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias; and (4) the hematopoietic system. The Respiratory System (Chapter 5) also discusses impairment as it relates to obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nNeurologic disorders associated with increased daytime sleepiness include central sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, periodic limb movement disorder, restless leg syndrome, depression, brain tumors, posttraumatic hypersomnolence, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis and postencephalopathy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, and neuromuscular disorders with sleep apnea. It is expected that the diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness has been supported by formal studies in a sleep laboratory.\n\nThe clinician can evaluate sleepiness with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale,2 which assesses the likelihood of dozing (never = 0 to high chance = 3) in different situations: sitting and reading, watching television, sitting in a public place, riding as a passenger for an hour, taking an afternoon nap, sitting and talking to someone, sitting after a nonalcohol lunch, and stopped in traffic in a car. A score of 10/24 is equal to excessive sleepiness, or class 2 impairment. This scale correlates with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which supports pathologic sleep in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. See Table 13-4 for impairment due to sleep and arousal disorders.\n\n\n13.3d Mental Status, Cognition, and Highest Integrative Function\nMental status and integrative function deficits include the general effects of organic brain syndrome; dementia; and some specific, focal, and neurologic deficiencies. Mental status tests are used to screen and follow individuals, frequently with repeated testing. They usually cover measures of orientation, attention, immediate recall, calculations, abstraction, construction, information, and recall. Frequently used mental status tests that cover these domains include the 6-item, short Blessed Test,3 the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE),4 and the",
  "Section 114 - 3002 chars": "Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).5 These screening tests can identify severely impaired individuals and are used to determine whether further evaluation with neuropsychological testing is needed.\n\nNeuropsychological test battery covers many functional domains\u2014attention, language, memory, visuospatial skills, executive function, intelligence, motor speed, and educational achievement\u2014using tests with established validity and reliability. Individuals with severe cognitive impairments that have been identified on mental status tests will usually not benefit from neuropsychological evaluation. It is the person with subtle cognitive changes who benefits from neuropsychological testing. Neurologic disorders that have different behavioral ramifications amenable to neuropsychological evaluation include traumatic brain injury, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, human immunodeficiency virus, encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, neurotoxic exposure, chronic pain, and personality assessment in individuals with neurologic disease.\n\nThe criteria for evaluating mental status and cognitive impairment are based on the amount of interference with the ability to perform activities of daily living.\nThis information can be obtained from someone who has close and continual contact with the individual and can be documented using any one of numerous ADL indices that determine changes in activities of daily living (eg, Barthel ADL Index6 and Blessed Dementia Scale7). A tool that combines both cognitive skills and function is the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR),8-10 which covers memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, home and hobbies, community affairs, and personal care. This validated clinical assessment tool is reproduced in Table 13-5 to serve as an example of how to evaluate cognitive change in light of ADL impairment. One of the standardized mental status tests\u2014the short Blessed, NCSE, or MMSE\u2014can be used in conjunction with the CDR to rate the impairment. To use the CDR, score the individual\u2019s cognitive function for each category (M, O, JPS CA, HH, and PC) independently.\nThe maximum CDR score is 3. Memory is considered the primary category; the other categories are secondary. If at least three secondary categories are given the same numeric score as memory, then CDR = M. If three or more secondary categories are given a score greater or less than the memory score, CDR = the score of the majority of secondary categories unless three secondary categories are scored on one side of M and two secondary categories are scored on the other side of M. In this case, CDR = M. Adapted from 8\n\nCorresponding impairment ratings for CDR scores are listed in Table 13-6. A CDR score of 0.5 = class 1 impairment, CDR score of 1 = class 2, CDR score of 2 = class 3, and CDR score of 3 = class 4.\n\nSource: Morris JC.

  "Section 115 - 3011 chars": "13.3e Communication Impairments: Dysphasia and Aphasia\nCommunication involves comprehension, understanding, language, and effective interaction between and among individuals. Aphasia is a condition in which language function is defective or absent. It includes a lack of comprehension with deficits in vision, hearing, and language (both spoken and written), and also the inability to implement discernible and appropriate language symbols by voice, action, writing, or pantomime. Dysphasia is a language impairment that is less severe than aphasia (which literally means \u201cno speech\u201d) but still is associated with a lesion in the dominant parietal lobe. It presents as a communication problem due to receptive or expressive dysphasia or a combination of the two.\nInability to have a meaningful conversation because no nouns are used is an example of dysphasia. Other common errors include errors of grammatical structure, word-finding difficulties, and word substitution. Dysphasia and aphasia are different from dysarthria, which is imperfect articulation of speech due to disordered muscle control. Dysphonia is an impairment of sound production that causes difficulty speaking and understanding. Speech and communication impairments due to nonneurologic primary problems are discussed in Chapter 11, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Related Structures.\n\nDysphasia is the most common diagnosis, since most individuals usually retain some ability to communicate. An inability to understand language has a poorer prognosis than an inability to express language. Speech therapy is of little value in the absence of comprehension; therefore, compensatory techniques may not be learned when a receptive aphasia or dysphasia exists. Tests for dysphasia should be conducted after it is established how confused or disoriented the individual is and which side of the brain is dominant for speech. Cognition should also be evaluated after dysphasia mechanisms have been excluded.\n\nAphasia and dysphasia test batteries are frequently devised by the clinician and cover the following simple tasks: (1) listening to spontaneous speech or responses to simple questions; (2) pointing commands and questions that can be answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to test comprehension; (3) repeating words and phrases; (4) naming objects that have highand lowfrequency use; (5) reading comprehension and reading aloud (reading is related to educational achievement, which must be known before interpreting reading comprehension and reading aloud results); and (6) writing and spelling.12 If comprehension is relatively intact, the aphasia screening battery may be adequate to place an individual in class 1 or\n\n2. However, individuals with dysphasia may score poorly on aphasia and dysphasia test batteries\nwhile they demonstrate communicative competency for activities of daily living. This communicative competency may be measured by means of the Communicative Abilities in Daily Living (CADL),13 in which nonverbal communication is assessed.",
  "Section 116 - 3105 chars": "Table 13-7 describes the criteria for rating impairment due to aphasia or dysphasia.\n\n\n13.3f Emotional or Behavioral Impairments\nEmotional, mood, and behavioral disturbances illustrate the relationship between neurology and psychiatry. Emotional disturbances originating in verifiable neurologic impairments (eg, stroke, head injury) are assessed using the criteria in this chapter. Psychiatric features may also exist with primary neurologic disorders. Psychiatric features can range from irritability to outbursts of rage or panic and from aggression to withdrawal. Neurologic impairments producing psychiatric conditions are assessed using the neurologic examination, with an expanded neuropsychiatric history and the necessary ancillary tests.\nPsychiatric impairments may include depression, manic states, emotional fluctuations, socially unacceptable behavior, involuntary laughing or crying, impulsivity, general disinhibition with obsessive and scatological behaviors, and other kinds of CNS responses.\n\nPsychiatric manifestations and impairments that do not have documented neurologic impairments are evaluated using the criteria in the chapter on mental and behavioral impairments (See Table 13-8 and Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders).\n\nThe remainder of this chapter covers the impairments listed in Table 13-1. The following impairments are combined with the most severe category of cerebral impairment described previously. If no cerebral impairment exists, the following impairments can stand alone or be combined with each other using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\n\n13.4 Criteria for Rating Impairments of the Cranial Nerves\n\n13.4a Cranial Nerve I\u2014the Olfactory Nerve\nThe olfactory nerve is responsible for the sense of smell and odor recognition. It is located on the floor of the skull\u2019s frontal fossa and is only occasionally impaired from trauma or other mechanism. Lack of sense of smell may reduce taste perception, which is mediated by cranial nerves VII and IX. Partial or complete right or left dysosmia or anosmia, or a perversion of the sense of smell, parosmia, may occur. Combine the estimate for anosmia or parosmia (given only if the anosmia interferes significantly with daily activities) with any other permanent impairment to determine the whole person impairment. The Smell Identification TestTM15 is a quantitative test for smell with an extensive normative database. The maximum impairment from anosmia is 3%.\n\n\n13.4b Cranial Nerve II\u2014the Optic Nerve The optic nerves carry visual information from the eyes to the visual cortex of the brain. Loss of visual input can have a profound influence on the ability to perform ADL. Impairment ratings for vision loss are discussed in general in this chapter and in more detail in Chapter 12 (The Visual System).\n\nThe optic nerve is one neural component of the visual system. The other components include the retina; the optic chiasm, which is unique in that only half of the nerve fibers cross to the contralateral side; the optic tracts; optic radiation; and visual cortex.",
  "Section 117 - 3266 chars": "This section discusses vision loss due to prechiasmal lesions, such as optic nerve dysfunction (eg, optic neuritis), as well as postchiasmal vision loss due to cortical lesions (eg, hemianopia).\n\nGeneral Principles of Vision Assessment (see Chapter 12 for more detail)\nTables 13-9 and 13-10 in this section and the tables in Chapter 12 have been significantly revised from previous editions to reflect the effect of vision changes on the ability to perform ADL as listed in\n\nTable 1-2. When assessing vision, the ratings for visual acuity loss and visual field loss are combined to a global visual impairment rating as summarized in Table 12-1. Since vision in one eye still enables one to perform most ADL, binocular vision is weighted more heavily than monocular vision. Thus, vision loss in one eye will receive a much lower impairment rating than vision loss in both eyes.\nAs discussed in detail in Chapter 12, evaluation of near-vision is optional and visual acuity loss to 20/200 receives a 50% impairment rating (see Tables 12-2,\n\n12-3, and 12-4). Visual field loss is sampled in 10 meridians, two in each superior quadrant, three in each inferior quadrant (Figure 12-1). Thus, a homonymous upper quadrantanopia will receive an impairment rating of about 20%; an inferior quadrantanopia will be rated at about 30%; a homonymous hemianopia, at about 50% (Tables 12-5, 12-6, and 12-7).\n\nThe whole person impairment rating results from the visual acuity impairment rating and the visual field impairment rating are detailed in Section 12-4. If acuity or visual fields are normal, the whole person\n\nimpairment rating equals the abnormal visual impairment rating.\nVision Assessment Using Chapter 13\nDue to the neurologic basis of vision, some conditions affecting vision may be evaluated using the guidelines in this chapter. Simple cases of visual acuity loss without peripheral field loss, such as those caused by optic neuritis, can be evaluated using Table 13-9. More complex conditions should be evaluated according to the methodology detailed in Chapter 12.\n\nSimple cases of visual field loss, with normal acuity, may be evaluated using Table 13-10. Since postchiasmal lesions will result in vision loss in the contralateral hemifield of both eyes (eg, homonymous hemianopia or quadrantanopia), visual field tests can be an important diagnostic tool in localizing a lesion. For diagnostic purposes, a tangent screen test involving the central 30\u00b0 is often sufficient. For complex vision loss patterns, especially those with some remaining peripheral vision and noncongruous patterns as may occur in chiasmal lesions, a full evaluation as detailed in Chapter 12 is required.\n\nNote: This table is based on the best corrected acuity and assumes that the visual fields are normal. See Chapter 12 for more complex cases of visual acuity loss. Note that the ability to perform ADL depends largely on the acuity of the better eye.\n\nNote: This table assumes that the visual acuity is still normal (as in hemianopia with macular sparing). See Chapter 12 for more complex cases, including noncongruous visual field loss and visual field loss combined with visual acuity loss. Note that the ability to perform ADL depends on the extent of the binocular field.",
  "Section 118 - 3246 chars": "Lesions of the visual cortex may cause a homonymous visual field defect. Parietal lesions may cause visual neglect. Where possible, both these conditions should be evaluated for their effect on ADL skills.\nBecause of brain plasticity, gradual improvement over a considerable period of time is possible.\nEnsure that the impairment is permanent, ie, unlikely to change significantly over the next year. If the vision loss is accompanied by other neurologic dysfunction, use the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) to combine the impairment rating from both conditions.\n\n\n13.4c Cranial Nerves III, IV, and VI\u2014 the Oculomotor, Trochlear, and Abducens Nerves\nThe oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves innervate the muscles that move the eyeballs. The oculomotor nerve also controls pupil size and reaction to light. Malfunction of the oculomotor system results in strabismus, ie, misalignment of the visual axes. There are two main types of malfunction: ordinary or comitant strabismus, which occurs mainly in children, and paralytic or noncomitant strabismus, found mainly in adults.\n\nOrdinary or comitant strabismus involves a malfunction of the oculomotor control centers. The angle of deviation is approximately the same in all directions of gaze. This type often results in visual acuity loss in one eye (amblyopia); diplopia is uncommon. The impairment rating is based on the visual acuity loss (see Chapter 12).\n\nParalytic or noncomitant strabismus is due to a paresis of one of the oculomotor nerves and muscles. The angle of deviation of the visual axes varies with the direction of gaze. Diplopia (double vision) is common. Occlusion of one eye eliminates the diplopia but may have undesirable side effects (such as reduction of the binocular field of vision).\n\nIf diplopia exists only in the extremes of gaze, it does not interfere with general ADL skills. If double vision exists at or near the primary direction of gaze, it (or the necessary occlusion) may interfere with ADL skills and would warrant an impairment rating. Assessment should be based on well-documented, individualized considerations as discussed in Chapter 12.\n\n\n13.4d Cranial Nerve V\u2014the Trigeminal Nerve\nThe trigeminal nerve is a mixed nerve with sensory fibers to the face, cornea, anterior scalp, nasal and oral cavities, tongue, and supratentorial dura mater. The nerve also transmits motor impulses to the mastication muscles.\n\nEvaluate sensation in the parts served by the three major divisions of the trigeminal nerve with the usual techniques: pain, temperature, and touch. (See the description of loss of function due to sensory deficit, pain, or discomfort under section 13.9, Criteria for Rating Impairments of the Peripheral Nervous System, Neuromuscular Junction, and Muscular System.) Compare the two sides of the face or body. Bilateral facial sensation loss is uncommon. Combine the impairment percentage for sensation loss that involves the trigeminal nerve with the estimated impairment percentage for pain or motor loss. Pin, cold, and light touch are the best parameters for localization of sensory findings on the face. They can outline impairment of either side of the face, a branch of, or complete trigeminal nerve impairment.",
  "Section 119 - 3580 chars": "Brief episodic trigeminal neuralgia or postherpetic neuralgia that involves a branch of the trigeminal nerve may be very severe and uncontrolled. Because there usually is no documented neurologic impairment except for a trigger point with trigeminal neuralgia or allodynia with postherpetic neuralgia, severe, uncontrolled, typical pain may be the impairment. Both atypical, episodic facial pain and typical, neuralgic pain may be evaluated (see Table 13-11) if they have occurred for months and interfere with daily activities. Motor impairment of the trigeminal nerve may affect chewing, swallowing, and speech articulation and may be accompanied by pain or a tic. Bilateral impairment is rare and may be severe. Daily activities may precipitate the pain. Speech, chewing, and swallowing impairments are considered in Chapter 9, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Related Structures.\n\nComment: This condition occurs in 30% of individuals with ophthalmic herpes. Pain may last for years and is associated with a high suicide risk because of severe uncontrolled neuralgic pain preventing normal usual activities.\n\n\n13.4f Cranial Nerve VIII\u2014the Vestibulocochlear Nerve\nCranial nerve VIII is composed of nerves from two adjacent nuclei. The cochlear portion of the nerve is concerned with hearing, and the vestibular portion of the nerve is concerned with vertigo and position and orientation in space. See Chapter 11 for evaluation of hearing impairment without known nerve dysfunction.\n\nTinnitus in the presence of unilateral hearing loss may impair speech discrimination and adversely influence the ability to carry out daily activities, especially in crowds or noisy places. Therefore, add up to 5% to the impairment evaluation for severe unilateral hearing loss due to tinnitus when ADL are affected.\n\nDysfunction of the vestibular part of the eighth nerve may be unilateral or bilateral. The impaired person may or may not be able to compensate for a unilateral loss. With bilateral loss of vestibular function, equilibrium and station are dependent on other systems, such as those for visual cues and kinesthetic senses; however, those systems may be inadequate for normal movement or ambulation.\n\nVertigo is the most disturbing symptom of vestibular dysfunction and is seldom, if ever, minor. Associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, headache, fear of movement, ataxia, and nystagmus. Movement or environmental object movement may worsen these uncomfortable symptoms. Vertigo as a single entity is evaluated in Chapter 11. Equilibrium and balance impairment is significant if daily activities are limited. See Table 13-13 for criteria for rating impairment of the vestibulocochlear nerve. Criteria of vestibular impairment are detailed in the section discussing equilibrium in Chapter 11, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Related Structures.\n\n\n13.4g Cranial Nerves IX and X\u2014the Glossopharyngeal and Vagus Nerves These are mixed nerves that supply sensory fibers\nchiefly to the posterior one third of the tongue and to the pharynx, larynx, and trachea. Involvement of the glossopharyngeal nerve by neuralgia usually is selflimiting or treatable and not permanent; the nerve\u2019s involvement may cause a condition similar to trigeminal (V) nerve tic or neuralgia. If the neuralgia persists uncontrolled for a period of months, the physician may be justified in assigning a percentage of impairment that is similar to trigeminal nerve impairment (use Table 13-11). Sensory impairments may contribute to difficulties with breathing, swallowing, speaking, and visceral functions.",

Impairment of this nerve is judged according to the effects on swallowing and speech, which are considered in Chapter 11, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Related Structures. This nerve also can affect head turning and shoulder motion; related impairments are evaluated according to criteria in Guides Chapters 15, The Spine, and 16, The Upper Extremities.\n\n\n13.4i Cranial Nerve XII\u2014the Hypoglossal Nerve\nThis is a motor nerve that innervates the musculature of the tongue. Unilateral loss of function is not considered to be impairment. Bilateral loss may result in impaired swallowing, breathing, and speech articulation (see Table 13-14). Speech articulation and swallowing are considered in Chapter 11.\n\n\n13.5 Criteria for Rating Impairments of Station, Gait, and Movement Disorders\n\n13.5a Station and Gait Disorders\nProblems maintaining balance and a stable gait can develop from a CNS or peripheral neurologic impairment. On physical examination, the physician may observe loss of equal arm or leg movement, falling or staggering to one or the other side, inability to control starting or stopping, and arrhythmic body or extremity movements. Increased tone in the lower extremities from a CNS lesion such as traumatic\n\nbrain injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis may result in a spastic paraparesis or spasticity in one limb.\nLoss of station or Romberg sign (falling with eyes closed) may indicate dysfunction in the peripheral nerves or their ascending pathways to the brain.\nPeripheral neuropathy, identified by examination and electrodiagnostic tests, is frequently associated with complaints of imbalance or stumbling, since information from sensory receptors is altered.\n\nImpairment ratings for station and gait disorders are determined according to the effect on ambulation (see Table 13-15). Other anatomic or functional changes from other body systems, such as the musculoskeletal system, are combined with the neurologic assessment for station and gait.\n\n\n13.5b Movement Disorders\nMovement disturbances resulting from cerebral dysfunction are impairments that may affect activities of daily living. Mild tics may have no impact on daily activities, while other involuntary movements, such as tremors (resting, postural, and intention), chorea, athetosis, hemiballismus, and dystonia tone may prevent meaningful use of the extremity. Besides abnormal movements, difficulty with coordination for dexterous or precise movements may interfere with activity; these difficulties can develop from lesions in the basal ganglia or cerebellum. Coordinated movements include gait that may manifest as ataxia requiring use of an ancillary device. Movement disorders, therefore, are assessed for their interference with ADL as described in Tables 13-15, 13-16, and 13-17. For movement disorders affecting the lower extremities, use the station and gait section.",

Loss of use of that extremity results, in most instances, in greater impairment than would be the case with impairment of the limb on the nondominant side.\nTables 13-16 and 13-17 are used to rate upper extremity dysfunction from any lesion in the brain. Use these tables for rating upper extremity dysfunction, manifested by weakness, tremor, or pain, that affects ADL. The upper extremity impairment\nmay result from, but is not limited to, traumatic\n\nbrain injury, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Parkinson\u2019s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy), multiple sclerosis, and sequelae of CNS infection.\n\nWhen the spinal cord disorder affects both upper extremities, the individual\u2019s impairment is greater than indicated by a simple combination of impairments of the dominant and nondominant extremities. For these cases, Chapter 15, which covers neurologic impairment from spinal cord disorders, and other sections in this chapter should be used.\n\nThe impairment ratings given in Tables 13-16 and 13-17 are determined from neurologic examination of motor strength, coordination, and dexterity.\nFunctional activities such as buttoning a shirt, lacing shoes, writing, and performing a pegboard task can assess abilities needed for daily activities.\n\nImpairments resulting from spinal cord injuries and other adverse conditions include those relating to station and gait, use of the upper extremities, respiration, urinary bladder function, anorectal function, sexual function, and pain.\n\nSensory disturbances, including the loss of sense of touch, sense of pain, temperature perception, and sense of vibration and joint position, and paresthesias, dysesthesias, and phantom limb sensations may indicate spinal cord dysfunction. Autonomic system disorders, including disturbances in sweating patterns, regulation of circulation, and regulation of temperature, may occur. Impairment is determined according to the amount of functional impairment and the level of involvement.\n\nWhen an individual with a spinal cord injury has impairments of several functions or systems, for instance, those of station and gait (Table 13-15), as with hemiparesis and ataxia; of dexterity in using the upper extremity (Tables 13-16 and 13-17); and of bladder, bowel, or sexual functioning, the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) should be used to combine the whole person impairment estimates for the several functions.\n\nAccompanying disorders, such as trophic lesions, urinary calculi, osteoporosis, nutritional disturbances, infections, and reactive psychological states, may occur. The degree to which any of these conditions augments spinal cord impairment should be based on the criteria given in the Guides chapters dealing with those disorders.\n\n\n13.7a Respiratory System Neurologic Impairments\nNeurologic impairment of one\u2019s ability to breathe is considered in Table 13-18 only in terms of neurologic limitations.

Refer to Chapter 7, The Urinary and Reproductive Systems, and apply the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) if impairments of several organ systems are present.\n\n\n13.7c Anorectal System Neurologic Impairments\nThe ability to control emptying provides the criterion for evaluating permanent impairment of the anus and rectum due to spinal cord or other neurologic dysfunction (see Table 13-20).\n\n\n13.7d Sexual System Neurologic Impairments\nAwareness and capability of having an orgasm are the criteria for evaluating permanent impairment of sexual functioning that may result from spinal cord or other neurologic system disorders (see Table 13-21). The individual\u2019s previous sexual functioning should be considered by the physician; age is only one criterion for evaluating previous sexual functioning.\nAdjust for age according to criteria outlined in Chapter 7, The Urinary and Reproductive Systems.\n\n\n13.8 Criteria for Rating Impairments Related to Chronic Pain\nImpairment due primarily to intractable pain may greatly influence an individual\u2019s ability to function. Psychological factors can influence the degree and perception of pain: different individuals in similar circumstances may be impaired by pain to different degrees. A chronic pain syndrome may follow thalamic lesions, but this is rare. Chronic pain in this section covers the diagnoses of causalgia, posttraumatic neuralgia, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The new term complex regional pain syndrome, type I and type II, is not used here since it does not represent a single diagnostic criterion.16\n\nCausalgia is burning pain that develops in a distal extremity following trauma to a peripheral nerve. The burning pain is triggered by movement, light mechanical stimuli to the skin, and strong emotion. Other features include distal extremity swelling and skin that is smooth, mottled, cold, and sweaty.\nSympathetic block frequently relieves the pain. In posttraumatic neuralgia, the burning pain in the distribution of a nerve does not have the other clinical features and does not spread.\n\nReflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) occurs without known nerve lesions and is precipitated by minor soft tissue trauma. Burning spontaneous pain and stimulus-evoked pain are most pronounced in the\n\ndistal limb (allodynia, hyperpathia, and hyperalgesia). The affected limb is usually warmer acutely (less than 6 months) and then is colder. It is now generally believed that a central nervous system abnormality is present based on the autonomic changes of abnormal sweating and skin blood flow. The acute distal swelling usually responds to sympathetic block. In the chronic stage, trophic changes include alteration in nail and hair growth, thin shiny skin, osteoporosis, and restriction of passive movement.",
  "Section 123 - 3781 chars": "Postural or action tremor is not uncommon, while an associated movement disorder is relatively rare.\n\nTo rate these conditions for impairment, diagnosis is key and is based on clinical criteria. Besides the clinical findings previously described, a three-phase bone scan may show increased uptake in the acute and subacute periods. This study is known to have low sensitivity, 50%,17 and therefore cannot be used as a required criterion for the diagnosis. Plain x-rays may show patchy demineralization, particularly in a periarticular distribution, within months of the onset of RSD. Altered blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry and abnormal function in the sudomotor reflex also support the diagnosis. It is difficult to examine individuals who are experiencing these symptoms; therefore, once the criteria for the diagnosis have been met, the impact on ADL is determined.\n\nTo rate an impairment for causalgia, posttraumatic neuralgia, and RSD in an upper extremity, use Table 13-22. If a lower extremity needs to be rated for casualgia, posttraumatic neuralgia, or RSD, use\nthe station and gait impairment criteria given in Table 13-15.\n\n\n13.9 Criteria for Rating Impairments of the Peripheral Nervous System, Neuromuscular Junction, and Muscular System\nEvaluating the peripheral nervous system requires documentation of the extent of loss of function due to sensory deficit, pain, or discomfort; loss of muscular strength and control of specific muscles or groups of muscles; and alteration of autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Documentation of these deficiencies should include, if possible, descriptions of the abnormal finding on examinations of the spinal root(s), portion of the plexus, and/or peripheral nerve(s) that are involved. The mechanism or cause\n\nof the abnormality assists in determining the impairment duration and probable prognosis. Ancillary testing by neuroimaging (CT scans, MRIs, radiographs) and physiologic (EMG, nerve conduction velocity [NCV], and evoked responses) tests, may assist in reaching final conclusions.\n\nNeurologic evaluation of pain is based first on the individual\u2019s description of the character, location, intensity, duration, and persistence of the discomfort and on verification of the anatomic distribution of the neurologic defect. A description of the ways and the degrees to which the pain interferes with the individual\u2019s performance of activities of daily living and the factors that augment the discomfort should be included. Anatomic descriptions should be made according to the usual distributions of the roots, plexuses, and nerves of the nervous system when the distal digital nerves are being evaluated, especially in the hand, as indicated in Chapters 15 and 16.\n\nGrading procedures for sensory and motor impairments in single distal digital nerves of the hand are found in Chapter 16, The Upper Extremities. For evaluations of neurologic problems of the peripheral neuromuscular system, the standard techniques of neurologic examination are used (see Tables 13-23 and 13-24). The muscle strength grading system (Table 13-24) is similar to the system recommended by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom. Involvement of peripheral nerves or roots may lead to paralysis or weakness of the muscles supplied by them, as well as to characteristic sensory changes. The system of the Medical Research Council18 is the one recommended in the Guides for evaluating muscle function and testing impairments (Table 13-23). In this system, movement of the part is tested against the examiner\u2019s resistance plus gravity, without the effect of gravity, against gravity, and for slight or no movement.

Sensory dysfunction associated with peripheral nerve disorders is evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) How does the pain or sensory deficit interfere with the individual\u2019s performance of daily activities? (2) To what extent does the pain or sensory deficit follow the defined anatomic pathways of the root, plexus, or peripheral nerve? (3) To what extent does the description of the\n\npain or sensory deficit indicate that it is caused by a peripheral nerve abnormality? (4) To what extent does the pain or sensory deficit correspond to other disturbances of the involved nerve structure? Only persistent pain or discomfort that leads to permanent loss of function, in spite of maximum effort toward medical rehabilitation and allowing an optimal period of time for physiologic adjustment, should be evaluated as a permanent impairment. Pain that does not meet more than one of the above criteria is not considered to be within the scope of this section.\n\nPain is defined in Chapter 18 as \u201can unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.\u201d Pain is a subjective symptom and is difficult to evaluate, but its presence, anatomic background, and intensity may be verified with a thorough examination. Chronic pain for causalgia, posttraumatic neuralgia, and RSD is evaluated in Table 13-22.\n\nMotivation and malingering as they may relate to the presence or absence of an impairment or a supposed impairment are considered in Chapter 14, Mental and Behavioral Disorders.\n\nSensory dysfunction, to be rated, must be considered permanent. The methodology used for spinal nerves, brachial plexus, and individual nerves is described below. Terms used to describe sensory impairment that may not be readily apparent to all readers are defined. Sensation refers to the sensory perception of the primary sensory modalities, pain, heat, cold, and touch, those involved in protective sensation.\nSensibility refers to the discriminative features of sensation such as graphesthesia, stereognosis, or two-point discrimination. The issue of sensibility is important to the normal function of the hand. This is\nwhy sensory loss in the digits is focused on impaired two-point discrimination (see Table 16-10).\n\nGrading procedures for sensory and/or motor impairments in all peripheral nerves (except sensory loss in the digits (Table 16-10) is found in Tables 13-23 and 13-24. The maximum impairment for spinal roots, brachial plexus, and individual nerves is noted under the respective sections below.\n\n\n13.9a Roots of Spinal Nerves\nSpinal nerves are evaluated by loss of function in the peripheral nerve that receives contribution from the involved spinal root.

As did Chapter 13 (The Central and Peripheral Nervous System), this chapter assesses the brain; however, here the emphasis is on evaluating brain function and its effect on behavior for mental disorders. Unlike the other chapters in the Guides, this chapter focuses more on the process of performing a mental and behavioral impairment assessment. Numerical impairment ratings are not included; however, instructions are given for how to assess an individual\u2019s abilities to perform activities of daily living.\n\nThe following revisions have been made for the fifth edition:\n\n\n1. The importance of following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for determining a mental impairment is emphasized.1\n\n2. The section on social security disability assessment has been removed. The Social Security Administration criteria focus on disability and work disability assessment, which is not the purpose of the AMA Guides. However, some of the\nmaterial in this chapter is taken directly from Social Security Administration (SSA) regulations.2-4\n\n3. Additional case examples exemplify the relationship between diagnosis, typical symptoms and signs of the disorder, and the impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living. Examples are included for depression, personality disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The case examples, together with Table 14-1, should help clarify how, in common psychiatric disorders, one can provide a nonnumerical impairment rating. Some states have chosen to assign numerical percentages to these categories.\n\n4. A summary template of factors to be included in a psychiatric assessment has been added.\n\n\n14.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluations.\n\nSeveral principles, described below, are central to assessing mental impairment. A clear diagnosis is required to assess permanent mental or behavioral impairment. This diagnosis needs to be established according to DSM-IV criteria. The diagnosis is among the factors to be considered in assessing the severity and possible duration of the impairment, but it is not the sole criterion to be used.",
  "Section 129 - 3093 chars": "Motivation for improvement may be a key factor in the severity and extent of an individual\u2019s impairment, whether that impairment is physical or mental. The examiner needs to assess changes in motivation and whether problems in motivation are due to the illness or to secondary gains. Motivation is influenced by multiple factors, including the illness, as well as the individual\u2019s personality, coping style, self-esteem, and self-confidence. These factors may change over time. The loss of motivation for even purely pleasurable activities may be a sign or symptom of an illness such as depression or schizophrenia. However, some individuals may be demoralized or in some way unmotivated to improve by external circumstances (such as fiscal incentives to stay ill and maintain health insurance).\n\nAssessing impairment requires a thorough review of the history of the mental disorder, the history of the individual\u2019s ability to function over time, and his or her response to treatment and rehabilitation.\n\n\n14.1 a Interpretations of Symptoms and Signs\nThe individual\u2019s own description of his or her functioning and limitations is an important source of information. Information from nonmedical sources, such as family members and others who have knowledge of the person, may be useful in indicating the level of functioning and the severity of the impairment.\n\nInformation concerning the individual\u2019s behavior while performing activities of daily living is particularly useful in determining his or her ability to function. Results of work evaluations and rehabilitation programs, as well as information from day programs, are also useful in assessing level of functioning.\n\nInformation from both medical and nonmedical sources may be used to obtain detailed descriptions of the individual\u2019s activities of daily living, social functioning, concentration, persistence, pace, and ability to tolerate increased mental demands (stress). This information may be available from professionals in community mental health centers, daycare centers, and sheltered workshops, and it also can be provided by family members. If the descriptions from these sources are insufficiently detailed or in conflict with the observed clinical picture or the reports of others, it is necessary to resolve the inconsistencies. Any gaps in the history should also be explained.\n\nAn individual\u2019s level of functioning may vary considerably over time. The level of functioning at a specific time may seem relatively adequate or, conversely, rather poor. Proper evaluation of an impairment must take into account variations in the level of functioning over time to arrive at a determination of severity. Thus, it is important to obtain evidence over a sufficiently long period of time before the date of examination. This evidence should include treatment notes, hospital discharge summaries, work evaluations, and rehabilitation progress notes if they are available.\n\n\n14.1 b Description of Clinical Studies The use of well-standardized psychological tests, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale",
  "Section 130 - 3465 chars": "(WAIS) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) may improve diagnostic acumen and help establish the existence of a mental disorder. For example, the WAIS is useful in documenting mental retardation. Broad-based neuropsychological assessments using, for example, the Halstead-Reitan or the Luria-Nebraska batteries may be useful in determining deficiencies in brain functioning, particularly in individuals with subtle signs such as those that may be seen in traumatic brain injuries.\n\nTaking a standardized test requires concentration, persistence, and pacing; thus, observing individuals during the testing process may yield useful information. The summary of test results should include the objective findings, a description of what occurred during the testing, and the test results. A report of intellectual assessment should include a discussion of whether the obtained intelligence quotient (IQ) score is considered to be valid and consistent with the individual\u2019s impairment and degree of functional limitation.\n\n\n14.2 Psychiatric\nDiagnosis and Impairment\nIn general, the history, signs, and symptoms of a mental disorder should justify the diagnosis, which should be made according to DSM-IV criteria. If there is uncertainty about the exact diagnosis, the differential diagnosis should be discussed. Document adequate descriptions of impairments and functional limitations from the reports of professional sources, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, psychiatric social workers, and health professionals in hospitals and clinics. Data gathered over a period of years are particularly useful.\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, commonly known as DSM-IV, is a widely accepted classification system for mental disorders. It is similar to another system, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which also is in widespread use.5 The criteria for mental disorders include a wide range of signs, symptoms, and impairments. Many mental disorders are characterized by impairments in a number of\n\nareas. DSM-IV calls for a multiaxial evaluation. Each of five axes refers to a different class of information. The first three axes constitute the major diagnostic categories. These include the major clinical syndromes and the conditions that are the focus of treatment (axis I), the personality and developmental disorders (axis II), and the physical disorders and conditions that may be relevant to understanding and managing the care of the individual (axis III). Axis IV, referring to psychosocial stressors, and axis V, referring to adaptive functioning, may be particularly important for assessing impairment severity. In particular, axis V is a rating of the individual\u2019s global functional capacity and, like disability, is related directly to the effects of impairments.\n\nIn some individuals it is not possible to make a determination on the basis of the available information.\nUnder these circumstances, the examiner should not feel obligated to provide an opinion about which he or she is uncertain but should seek and review relevant information from additional sources, such as medical and employment records, before rendering an opinion. The examiner must also consider the effects that medication, motivation, and rehabilitation may have on the individual\u2019s signs, symptoms, and ability to function. A detailed discussion of these factors follows.",
  "Section 131 - 3037 chars": "14.2 a Effects of Medication\nAttention must be given to the effects of medication on the individual\u2019s signs, symptoms, and ability to function. Although psychoactive medications may control certain signs or symptoms, such as hallucinations, impaired attention span, restlessness, or hyperactivity, such treatment may not affect all impairments and limitations imposed by the mental disorder. If an individual\u2019s symptoms are attenuated by psychoactive medications, the evaluator should focus particular attention on limitations that may persist. Those limitations should be used as measures of the impairment\u2019s severity.\n\nPsychoactive medications used to treat some mental illnesses may cause drowsiness, blunted affect, or unwanted effects involving various body systems. Moreover, medications necessary to control such symptoms as hallucinations may result in decreased motivation and level of activity. These side effects should be considered in evaluating the overall severity of the individual\u2019s impairment and ability to function. As explained in Chapter 2, the evaluator may need to provide an impairment estimate for the drug\u2019s side effects.\n\n\n14.2 b Effects of Motivation\nAssessing motivation is difficult because lack of motivation may be hard to distinguish from mental impairment and is, in fact, a classic symptom of schizophrenia. When is an individual lacking energy, concentration, and initiative depressed or autistically preoccupied, and when is the individual unmotivated? Ultimately, making this distinction requires a clinical judgment, which should be aided by careful investigation of the individual\u2019s efforts and accomplishments before the onset of the alleged impairment and a search for associated signs and symptoms of common mental disorders.\n\nMotivation is a difficult issue for assessment since it is mutifactorial in nature, involving the following potential factors: (1) lack of motivation as a sign of illness such as depression or schizophrenia; (2) fear of losing entitlement or other benefits of being ill;\n(3) a side effect of some neuroleptic medications;\n(4) conscious malingering; (5) a consequence of demoralization of persons with any chronic illness;\n(6) social network support for illness; and others. Thus, the determination of motivation is often nonempirical, and conclusions are all too often drawn on the basis of prejudice. Many times, an individual\u2019s motivation is not well understood even after careful assessment.\n\nNevertheless, motivation is a link between impairment and disability. For some people, poor motivation is a major cause of poor functioning. An individual\u2019s underlying character may be important in determining whether he or she is motivated to benefit from rehabilitation. Personality characteristics usually remain unchanged throughout life. However, internal events and psychological reactions can influence the course of illness. An individual who tends to be dependent, for example, may become even more dependent as his or her illness proceeds.",
  "Section 132 - 3187 chars": "14.2 c Effects of Rehabilitation\nFrequently, the degree of vocational limitation of the individual with impairment of function is of paramount importance to the evaluator. This limitation may range from minimal to total. In addition, the severity of functional impairment may change with the course of the illness. When the individual needs less medical care, vocational skills may be intact, or the individual may have limitations that may or may not be reversible. The evaluator should judge the possible duration of the impairment that remains, whether remission is likely to be fast or slow, whether it will be partial or total, and whether the\n\nimpairment is likely to remain stable or to change. These considerations should contribute to the examiner\u2019s judgment about the degree of impairment.\n\nRehabilitation is a sine qua non in the treatment of most people who have recovered or are recovering from the acute phase of a mental disorder, especially a major mental disorder. Even if it is not possible to effect total remission, an outcome may be considered worthwhile if it has been possible to move the individual\u2019s functional impairment to a lesser degree.\n\nWhile for some persons lack of motivation appears to be a major feature of continuing impairment and may be a major feature of an ongoing mental disorder, many individuals who undergo proper rehabilitative measures, including some who have organic illnesses, achieve improvements in functioning.\nDetermining whether impaired functioning will persist is sometimes an imprecise science, and some degree of uncertainty about this prediction often exists. The use of the impairment label can be seen as pessimistic, providing an adverse prediction that may be self-fulfilling. However, the tendency for physicians and others to minimize psychiatric impairments must also be considered; this tendency may lead to failure to refer individuals for potentially helpful rehabilitative measures.\n\nAn important aspect of rehabilitation is the recognition that an individual who is taking certain types of medication may be able to sustain a satisfactory degree of functioning, whereas without medication he or she might fail to do so. For instance, there may be only a slight problem in the thinking process while the person is taking a suitable medication but a severe one if he or she is not taking medication. The physician should note the individual\u2019s performance with and without medication.\n\nAnother consideration is providing an employer the assurance that a worker who is taking the proper medication and is in an appropriate job can avoid injury both to himself or herself and to coworkers. An analogy is seen in the care and treatment of a worker who has seizures: in such an instance, informing and educating the worker, as well as his or her family, employer, and coworkers, are vital steps and should be a part of the rehabilitation process.\n\nJust as there are degrees of impairment, total rehabilitation may not be possible, as is the case in the great majority of individuals afflicted with schizophrenia. To use an analogy from physical medicine, it is essentially impossible for an amputated leg to be",
  "Section 133 - 3154 chars": "replaced, and the affected individual cannot hope to regain perfect ambulation. However, a well-fitted prosthesis, accompanied by practice and training, can greatly improve the individual\u2019s ability to walk. If, in addition, the individual obtains suitable transportation, he or she may be restored to full gainful employment. If normal ambulation is a job requirement, an employer may be able to provide an alternative position or to modify existing tasks so that they can be performed by an amputee making skillful use of a prosthesis.\n\nAlthough the analogy between the loss of a limb and the loss of capability resulting from a mental disorder has limitations, impairment from a mental disorder can be just as real and severe as the impairment resulting from an injury or other illness. The link between motivation and recovery may need strengthening in individuals who are impaired by either physical or mental illness. This task falls primarily to rehabilitationists and psychiatrists, but others can assist. An employer\u2019s providing alternative tasks or modifying existing work conditions may be as much a part of restoring vocational possibilities to an individual with mental illness as it is to one recovering from an injury or to one who has elements of both mental and physical illness.\n\n\n14.3 A Method of Evaluating Psychiatric Impairment\nPercentages are not provided to estimate mental impairment in this edition of the Guides. Unlike cases with some organ systems, there are no precise measures of impairment in mental disorders. The use of percentages implies a certainty that does not exist. Percentages are likely to be used inflexibly by adjudicators, who then are less likely to take into account the many factors that influence mental and behavioral impairment. In addition, the authors are unaware of data that show the reliability of the impairment percentages. After considering this difficult matter, the Committee on Disability and Rehabilitation of the American Psychiatric Association advised Guides contributors against the use of percentages in the chapter on mental and behavioral disorders of the fourth edition, and that remains the opinion of the authors of the present chapter.\n\nNo available empirical evidence supports any method for assigning a percentage of impairment of the whole person; however, the following approach may be helpful in estimating the extent of mental impairments. Not everyone who has a mental or behavioral disorder is limited in the ability to perform activities of daily living; however, there are individuals with less than chronic, but still unremitting, impairments who are severely limited in some areas of function.6\n\nTranslating specific impairments directly and precisely into functional limitations is a complex and poorly understood process. Current research finds little relationship between such psychiatric signs and symptoms as those identified during a mental status examination and the ability to perform competitive work. However, four main categories exist that assess many areas of function: (1) ability to perform activities of daily living; (2) social functioning;",
  "Section 134 - 3060 chars": "(3) concentration, persistence, and pace; and\n(4) deterioration or decompensation in work or worklike settings. Independence, appropriateness, and effectiveness of activities should also be considered. The four aspects of functional limitation are discussed below and can be linked, or causally related, to specific impairments as described in Table 14-1. The examiner should assess and record the extent of function in all these categories.\n\n\n14.3 a Activities of Daily Living\nActivities of daily living, as indicated in Table 1-2, include such activities as self-care, personal hygiene, communication, ambulation, travel, sexual function, and sleep. Any limitations in these activities of daily living should be related to the mental disorder rather than to such factors as lack of money or transportation. In the context of the individual\u2019s overall situation, the quality of these activities is judged by their independence, appropriateness, effectiveness, and sustainability. It is necessary to define the extent to which the individual is capable of initiating and participating in these activities independent of supervision or direction.\n\nThe examiner must assess not simply the number of activities that are restricted but the overall degree of restriction or combination of restrictions. For example, a person who is able to cook and clean might be considered to have marked restriction of daily activities if he or she were too fearful to leave home to shop or go to the physician\u2019s office.\n\n\n14.3 b Social Functioning\nSocial functioning refers to an individual\u2019s capacity to interact appropriately and communicate effectively with other individuals. Social functioning includes the ability to get along with others, such as family members, friends, neighbors, grocery clerks, landlords, or bus drivers. Impaired social functioning may be demonstrated by a history of altercations, evictions, firings, fear of strangers, avoidance of interpersonal relationships, social isolation, or similar events or characteristics. It is helpful to give specific examples illustrating the individual\u2019s impaired social functioning.\n\nStrength in social functioning may be documented by an individual\u2019s ability to initiate social contact with others, communicate clearly with others, and interact and actively participate in group activities. Cooperative behavior, consideration for others, awareness of others\u2019 sensitivities, and social maturity also need to be considered. Social functioning in work situations may involve interactions with the public, responding to persons in authority such as supervisors, or being part of a team.\n\nThe overall degree of interference with a particular aspect or combination of aspects is as significant as the number of aspects in which social functioning is impaired. For example, a hostile, uncooperative person who is tolerated by local storekeepers and neighbors may have marked restriction in overall functioning because antagonism and hostility are not acceptable in the workplace or in social contexts.",
  "Section 135 - 3241 chars": "14.3c Concentration, Persistence, and Pace Concentration, persistence, and pace are needed to perform many activities of daily living, including task completion. Task completion refers to the ability to sustain focused attention long enough to permit the timely completion of tasks commonly found in activities of daily living or work settings. Deficiencies in concentration, persistence, and pace are best noted from previous work attempts or from observations in worklike settings, such as day-treatment centers and incentive work programs. Describing specific examples of the individual\u2019s capabilities is useful. Major impairments of these abilities can often be assessed through direct psychiatric examinations or psychological testing. However, mental status examinations or psychological test data alone should not be considered adequate to fully describe the individual\u2019s concentration and sustained ability to perform\nwork tasks.\n\nConcentration and mental status may be assessed by having the individual perform such tasks as subtracting 7s serially from 100. In psychological tests of intelligence or memory, concentration is assessed through tasks requiring short-term memory or tasks that must be completed within established time limits. Strengths and weaknesses in mental concentration may be described in terms of frequency of errors, the time it takes to complete the task, and the extent to which assistance is required to complete the task. A person who appears to concentrate adequately during a mental status examination or a psychological test may not do so in a setting more like one common to the working world.\n\n\n14.3d Deterioration or Decompensation in Complex or Worklike Settings\nDeterioration or decompensation in complex or worklike settings refers to an individual\u2019s repeated failure to adapt to stressful circumstances. In the face of such circumstances, the individual may withdraw from the situation or experience exacerbation of signs and symptoms of a mental disorder; that is, he or she may decompensate and have difficulty maintaining performance of activities of daily living, continuing social relationships, and completing tasks.\nStresses common to the work environment include attendance, making decisions, scheduling, completing tasks, and interacting with supervisors and peers. It is useful to give examples of the individual\u2019s decompensation and the stresses that might have brought it about.\n\nIn assessing the individual\u2019s stress tolerance, the examiner should be mindful of the following issues. First, stress may be defined in reference to a \u201creasonable man\u201d standard in some systems and to other standards in other systems. Second, the circumstances of a given case might suggest a prophylactic preclusion from certain types of tasks or work settings. For example, a person with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder that date from a robbery and assault might require a prophylactic preclusion from jobs involving contact with the general public or handling large sums of money. In contrast, a stressful personality clash between the individual and his or her supervisor might require only that the individual be precluded from working with that particular supervisor.",
  "Section 136 - 3254 chars": "14.3e Classes of Impairment Due to Mental and Behavioral Disorders\nTable 14-1 provides a guide for rating mental impairment in each of the four areas of functional limitation on a five-category scale that ranges from no impairment to extreme impairment. The following are recommended as anchors for the categories of the scale.\n\n\n1. None means no impairment is noted in the function.\n\n2. Mild implies that any discerned impairment is compatible with most useful functioning.\n\n3. Moderate means that the identified impairments are compatible with some, but not all, useful functioning.\n\n4. Marked is a level of impairment that significantly impedes useful functioning. Taken alone, a marked impairment would not completely preclude functioning, but together with marked limitation in another class, it might limit useful functioning.\n\n5. Extreme means that the impairment or limitation is not compatible with useful function. Extreme\n\nimpairment in carrying out activities of daily living implies complete dependency on another person for care. In the sphere of social functioning, extreme impairment implies that the individual engages in no meaningful social contact, as with a person who is in a withdrawn, catatonic state. An extreme limitation in concentration, persistence, and pace means that the individual cannot attend to conversation or any productive task; this might be seen in a person who is in an acute confusional state or in a person with a complete loss of shortterm memory.\n\nA person who cannot tolerate any change at all in routines or in the environment, or one who cannot function and who decompensates when schedules change in an otherwise structured environment, has an extreme limitation of adaptive functioning and an extreme psychiatric impairment. Such an individual might, for example, experience a psychotic episode if a meal is not served on time or might have a panic attack if left without a companion in any situation.\n\nIn the ordinary individual, extreme impairment in only one area or marked limitation in two or more spheres would be likely to preclude the performance of any complex task, such as one involving recreation or work, without special support or assistance, such as that provided in a sheltered environment.\n\nAn individual impaired to a moderate degree in all four categories of functioning would be limited in the ability to carry out many, but not all, complex tasks. Mild and moderate limitations reduce overall performance but do not preclude some performance. Table 14-2 links specific impairments to potential associated disabilities.\n\nTranslating these guidelines for rating individual impairment on ordinal scales into a method for assigning percentage of impairments, as if valid estimates could be made on precisely measured interval scales, cannot be done reliably. One cannot be certain that the difference in impairment between a rating of mild and moderate is of the same magnitude as the difference between moderate and marked. Furthermore, a moderate impairment does not imply a 50% limitation in useful functioning, and an estimate of moderate impairment in all four categories does not imply a 50% impairment of the whole person.",
  "Section 137 - 3471 chars": "Eventually, research may disclose direct relationships between medical findings and percentages of mental impairment. Until that time, the medical profession must refine its concepts of mental and physical impairment, improve its ability to measure limitations, and continue to make clinical judgments.\n\n\n14.4 Assessing\nImpairment Severity\nThe following factors, discussed below, must be considered when assessing severity of an individual\u2019s impairment: (1) the effects of treatment; (2) the effects of structured settings; (3) the variability of mental disorders; (4) an assessment of workplace function; and (5) the effects of common mental and behavioral conditions.\n\n\n14.4a Effects of Treatment\nProblems often arise in evaluating mental impairments of individuals who have long histories of repeated hospitalizations or prolonged outpatient care with supportive therapy and medication. Individuals with\n\nchronic psychotic disorders commonly have their lives structured in such a way as to minimize stress and reduce their signs and symptoms. Such individuals may therefore be more impaired in terms of work capability than their signs and symptoms indicate. The results of a single examination may not adequately describe the ability of such a person to function in a sustained way. Thus, it is necessary to review information pertaining to the individual\u2019s functioning at times of increased stress, such as in a worklike setting.\n\n\n14.4b Effects of Structured Settings\nIn cases involving long-standing mental disorders, overt symptoms may be particularly controlled or attenuated by psychosocial factors, such as placement in a hospital, halfway house, board and care facility, or similar environment. These highly structured and supportive settings may greatly reduce the mental demands placed on an individual. Although overt signs and symptoms of the underlying mental disorder may be minimized with lowered mental demands, the individual\u2019s ability to function outside of the structured setting may not have changed. The evaluator of an individual whose symptoms are controlled in a structured setting must consider such factors as the individual\u2019s response to past attempts to function successfully at work or in other unstructured environments.\n\n\n14.4 c Variability of Mental Disorders\nIn judging the degree of mental impairment, it is important to recognize that there are various types of mental disorders, each of which, like a physical disorder, has its own natural course and unique characteristics. In addition, degrees of impairment may vary considerably among individuals with the same diagnosis.\n\nIt is apparent that some serious mental disorders are chronic. The term remission, rather than cure, is therefore used to indicate an individual\u2019s improvement. The remission may be intermittent, long term, or short term, and it may occur in stages rather than all at once. For example, an episode of depression that follows a stressful life event may turn out to be an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, which often is a short-term, self-limiting illness that clears up when the stressful situation is relieved. Other affective disorders have their own patterns of recurrence and chronicity that often, but not always, respond well to therapeutic interventions. Thus, an individual with a medication-resistant major depressive episode may remain unable to sleep, eat, concentrate, etc, for months or even years.",
  "Section 138 - 3095 chars": "14.4d Assessment of Workplace Function Assessment of the ability to perform activities at work requires evaluation of similar abilities, along with unique skills, particular to the workplace. To assess the ability of an individual to function in the workplace, the evaluator may obtain additional information by using a multidimensional description of remaining work-related abilities. Four capacities, indicated below, have been used by SSA regulations to characterize residual functional capacity.\n\n\n1. Understanding and memory relate to the individual\u2019s ability to remember procedures related to work; to understand and remember short, simple instructions; and to understand and remember detailed instructions.\n\n\n2. Sustained concentration and persistence relate to the individual\u2019s ability to carry out short, simple instructions; carry out detailed instructions; maintain attention and concentration for extended periods of time; perform activities within a given schedule; maintain regular attendance and be punctual within customary tolerances; sustain an ordinary routine without special supervision; work with or near others without being distracted; make simple work-related decisions; complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms; and perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number of and unreasonably long rest periods.\n\n\n3. Social interaction involves the individual\u2019s ability to interact appropriately with the general public; ask simple questions or request assistance; accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors; get along with coworkers and peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes; maintain socially appropriate behavior; and adhere to basic standards of neatness and cleanliness.\n\n\n4. Adaptation is the ability to respond appropriately to changes in the work setting; to be aware of normal hazards and take appropriate precautions; to use public transportation and travel to and within unfamiliar places; to set realistic goals; and to make plans independently of others.\n\n\n14.4e Effects of Common Mental and Behavioral Conditions\nSome categories of mental and behavioral conditions, including substance-dependence disorders, personality disorders (especially antisocial personality disorders), and adjustment disorders, are characterized by abnormal emotional responses to stressful life events, which resolve in a short time when the stressor is removed. The behavior during both controlled intervals and times of exacerbation should be noted.\n\nThe schizophrenias are usually chronic disorders; the onset may be insidious and recognized only in retrospect. Certain organic disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and lifelong mental retardation, are persistent and chronic, and treatment consists of minimizing the functional loss inherent to the pathophysiologic changes. Evaluation of mental retardation and autism for social security considers the presence of mental incapacity evidenced by",
  "Section 139 - 3187 chars": "(1) dependence on others for personal needs, such as toileting, eating, dressing, or bathing; and (2) an inability to follow directions, which precludes tests of intellectual functioning; or (3) a valid verbal performance or full-scale IQ of 59 or less, or a score of 60 through 69 along with physical or mental impairment affecting daily activities, social functioning, or concentration, persistence, and pace. Common psychiatric diagnoses, associated impairments in the\nform of demonstrable signs and symptoms, and commonly seen areas of decreased performance are discussed below and in Table 14-2 .\n\n\n14.4e.1 Substance Abuse and Personality Disorders\nChronic substance abuse and personality disorders can coincide. The effects of chronic substance abuse include impairments in concentration, attention, impulse control, judgment, etc, which often last for the duration of the dependency. These behaviors can also occur with personality disorders. To evaluate the severity of the impairment, the examiner needs to assess whether there are (1) restrictions in activities of daily living; (2) difficulties in maintaining social functioning; (3) difficulties in completing tasks in a timely manner because of deficiencies in concentration, persistence, and pace; and (4) repeated episodes of decompensation and loss of adaptive functioning, averaging three times per year, with each episode lasting 2 or more weeks.\n\n\n14.4e.2 Somatoform Pain Disorders\nPain that accompanies a medical impairment is generally taken into account in the impairment ratings throughout the Guides. Chronic pain and pain exceeding the anticipated amount are discussed in Chapter 18. Mental illness may distort the perception of pain. Pain may be part of a somatic delusion in an individual with a major depression or a psychotic disorder. Pain may become the object of an obsessive preoccupation, or it may be the chief complaint in a conversion disorder. A frequent problem in pain assessment is the failure of physicians to agree on whether there is an adequate physical explanation for the pain. It would be useful for the examining psychiatrist to understand whether other professionals treating the individual feel that his or her symptoms are out of proportion with the physical findings. If they are, the psychiatrist should consider this finding in making a differential diagnosis and should recognize the possibility of the presence of somatoform or other mental disorders.\n\nThe essential feature of somatoform pain disorder in DSM-IV is preoccupation with pain in the absence of physical findings that adequately account for the pain and its intensity, as well as the presence of psychological factors that are judged to have a major role in the onset, severity, exacerbation, and maintenance of pain. In the past, this syndrome has been called psychogenic pain disorder or idiopathic pain disorder, but these terms are often used more loosely to describe any complaint of pain that is greater than the physician expects for the average person who has the same physical findings. The physician should recognize that anxiety and depression almost always magnify pain, and vice versa.",
  "Section 140 - 3066 chars": "The following guidelines may be useful in determining whether pain is a symptom of a mental impairment: (1) All possible somatic causes of the pain have been eliminated by careful, comprehensive medical examinations; (2) some significant emotional stressor has occurred in the individual\u2019s life that may have acted as a triggering agent, and the stressor and the pain have occurred in a reasonable sequence; and (3) evidence exists of a mental disorder other than a conversion-related one, and the pain may be a symptom of nonconversion-related mental disorders. For example, delusional pain may occur in an individual who has a subtle paranoid disorder such as might be the case with someone who believes Martians are irradiating his head, producing constant headaches, and where the belief antedated the pain.\n\n\n14.4e.3 Malingering\nMalingering may arise with mental disorders as well as with nonpsychiatric conditions. Examiners should be aware of this possibility when evaluating impairments. The possibility of obtaining monetary awards and avoiding work increases the likelihood of malingering. Certain symptoms, such as headache, lowback pain, peripheral neuralgia, and vertigo, are difficult to objectively assess. Conditions that have more of an apparent organic basis, such as appendicitis, a fracture, or pregnancy, tend to be more amenable to objective diagnostic studies than are some psychiatric and neurologic complaints.\nMalingerers with supposed psychiatric conditions may be seen in circumstances involving the avoidance of an unpleasant duty or requirement, such as going to jail or entering military service, and may be seen seeking insurance or entitlement benefits.\n\nRather than giving outright fabrications, individuals may consciously or unconsciously exaggerate the symptoms of a disorder in the clinical or impairment evaluation setting. Malingering may be suspected when the individual\u2019s symptoms are vague, ill defined, overdramatized, inconsistent, or not in conformity with signs and symptoms known to occur. In this situation, results of the physical and mental status examinations and other data and information of the evaluation may be inconsistent with the nature and intensity of the person\u2019s complaints.\n\nCircumstances in which an unusual number of illdefined complaints occur in a circumscribed group, perhaps in a setting of poor morale or conflict, also may be viewed with suspicion. But the most appropriate approach for the examining physician is one of clinical neutrality, the application of standard interview and diagnostic procedures, and, if warning signs appear, a careful investigation that includes multidisciplinary evaluation and psychological testing as appropriate. For a more elaborate discussion of malingering, a text may be useful.7, 8\n\nTable 14-2 Selected Impairments and Common Limitations in Ability\n\nImpairment Schizophrenia\n\nSchizophrenia or depression\nSchizophrenia, depression, or anxiety disorder\nPosttraumatic stress disorder Borderline personality disorder Panic disorder with agoraphobia",

His father was a general surgeon. He envied and resented his father and was ambivalent about his death.

The spine consists of four regions: the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral vertebrae, and associated soft tissues including muscles, ligaments, disks, and neural elements. Impairments of the spine discussed in this chapter include lumbar, thoracic, cervical, spinal cord, and pelvic impairments.",
  "Section 144 - 3153 chars": "The following revisions have been made for the fifth edition: (1) The use of the diagnosis-related estimate (DRE) and range-of-motion (ROM) methods has been modified, and applications are described in greater detail; (2) impairment is rated only when the individual has reached maximal medical improvement (MMI); (3) impairments within a DRE category encompass a range, with adjustments of up to 3%;\n(4) spinal cord injury is evaluated according to the functional approach in the nervous system chapter;\n(5) the \u201cdifferentiators\u201d in the fourth edition have been replaced by \u201cobjective findings\u201d and are more specifically defined; and (6) alterations of motion segment integrity have been redefined to reflect current scientific knowledge.\nAs in the fourth edition,1 the DRE method is the primary method used to evaluate individuals with an injury. Use the ROM method when the impairment is not caused by an injury or when an individual\u2019s condition is not well represented by a DRE category. The ROM method is also now used to evaluate individuals with an injury at more than one level in the same spinal region and in certain individuals with recurrent pathology. This approach addresses the difficulty of assigning these individuals to an appropriate DRE category. An exception, however, is individuals with corticospinal involvement who have been treated with decompression and multilevel fusions within the same region; they should be rated by the DRE method because assessing ROM in paralyzed individuals is difficult. Finally, the range-of-motion method should be used if statutorily mandated in a particular jurisdiction. A more detailed description of the applications of either method is provided in Section 15.2.\n\nAs stated in this edition, an individual with a spinal condition is rated only when the condition is stable (unlikely to change within the next year regardless of treatment), ie, when MMI has been reached (Chapter 1 and Glossary). The individual is evaluated based on medical findings that are present when MMI has been reached.\n\n\n15.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss\nthe Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.\n\nThe evaluation should include a comprehensive, accurate medical history; a review of all pertinent records; a comprehensive description of the individual\u2019s current symptoms and their relationship to daily activities; a careful and thorough physical examination; and all findings of relevant laboratory, radiologic (imaging), electrodiagnostic, and ancillary tests. It is also essential that the rater include in the report a description of how the impairment was calculated. Because many ratings are reviewed by other physicians and nonmedical personnel, the explanation of the calculation will lead to a better understanding of the method used and the report will be considered more reliable and complete.",
  "Section 145 - 3021 chars": "15.1\na Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nHistory\nThe history should be based primarily on the individual\u2019s own statements rather than secondhand information. While the medical history should consider information from others, the physician should be cautious about using subjective information from medical records. It is not appropriate to question the individual\u2019s integrity. If information from the individual is inconsistent with what is known about the medical condition, circumstances, or written records, the physician should report and comment on the inconsistencies.\n\nThe history must describe in detail the chief complaint and the quality, severity, anatomic location, frequency, and duration of symptoms, including pain, numbness, paresthesias, and weakness.\nDocument exacerbating and alleviating factors and the way in which the condition interferes with daily activities. The physician should elicit the history of when and how the condition started, any precipitating events or factors, and the relationship to any previous spine problems.2-4\n\nThe history should include the individual\u2019s description, in his or her own words, of how the symptoms developed and the assumed cause. In addition, the response to treatment and the results of special studies that have been performed should be described.\nThe physician should either review available roentgenograms and other imaging studies personally or report the findings as being those of another reviewer (based on reports). A review of organ systems and of the general medical history can provide potentially helpful information, including complicating medical problems that can affect the diagnosis, treatment plan, prognosis, disability, etc.\n\nExamination\nPhysical examination of nonmusculoskeletal areas (eg, nervous system) is discussed in other parts of the Guides. Since a targeted neurologic assessment is needed for individuals with back or neck problems, the physician must have a good grasp of basic neurologic examination techniques and principles. Guided by the history, the physician should focus on\nspine-related physical findings, such as range of motion, reflexes, muscle strength and atrophy, sensory deficits, root tension signs, gait, and the need for assistive devices (Table 15-1). Range-of-motion measurements are discussed later in this chapter.\n\nThe physical examination of the spine must be placed in the context of the individual\u2019s general health and condition. For findings such as atrophy, consider other possible explanations besides spine impairment, such as previous joint surgery or hypertrophy of the contralateral side from overuse. Other physical conditions may be present that influence motor and sensory function, ranges of motion, and sciatic nerve tension. Examination of associated systems (vascular, nervous) and follow-up of any possibly significant information from the history and physical examination will allow the physician to distinguish between spine-related findings and other abnormalities.2-4",
  "Section 146 - 3090 chars": "The physician should record and discuss any physical findings that are inconsistent with the history.\nMany physical findings are subjective, ie, potentially under the influence of the individual. It is important to appreciate this and not confuse such observations with truly objective findings.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this text to discuss in detail how the physical examination is performed; textbooks are available to cover that subject. A few aspects of particular value to the impairment evaluation will be discussed subsequently.\n\nThoracic Spine\n\nCervical Spine\n\nEvaluation of Sciatic Nerve Tension Signs Sciatic nerve tension signs are important indicators of irritation of the lumbosacral nerve roots. While most commonly seen in individuals with a herniated lumbar disk, this is not always the case. In chronic nerve root compression due to spinal stenosis, tension signs are often absent. A variety of nerve tension signs have been described. The most commonly used is the straight leg raising test (SLR). When performed in the supine position, the hip is flexed with the knee extended. In the sitting position, with the hip flexed 90\u00b0, the knee is extended. The test is positive when thigh and/or leg pain along the appropriate dermatomal distribution is reproduced. The degree of elevation at which pain occurs is recorded.\n\nResearch indicates that the maximum movement of nerve roots occurs when the leg is at an angle of 20\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 relative to the trunk. However, this may vary depending on the individual\u2019s anatomy. Further, the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots are those that primarily change their length when straight leg raising is performed. Thus, pathology at higher levels of the lumbar spine is often associated with a negative SLR. Root tension signs are most reliable when the pain is elicited in a dermatomal distribution. Back pain on\n\nSLR is not a positive test. Hamstring tightness must also be differentiated from posterior thigh pain due to root tension.\n\nWith time, spine-related symptoms usually improve, and a positive root tension (SLR) test is elicited only at the extremes of hip flexion (leg raising). While straight leg raising in disk herniation is a relatively sensitive test (72% to 97%), it is nonspecific (11% to 45%).5 Straight leg raising of the asymptomatic limb (eg, crossed SLR) that produces sciatica in the limb with symptoms (crossed positive) is a specific (85% to 100%) but less sensitive (23% to 42%) test.\n\nResults of supine SLR can be further validated by recording the individual\u2019s response to gentle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the ankle, and to internal and external rotation of the hip when the straightened leg is raised to the point where symptoms begin. Normally, ankle dorsiflexion and hip internal rotation increase the pain, and ankle plantar flexion and hip external rotation decrease the sciatica. Since sitting knee extension and supine hip flexion culminate in essentially identical positions, symptomatic responses to the two types of SLR should be similar, although the angle at which pain is elicited may vary.",
  "Section 147 - 3745 chars": "The reverse SLR or femoral stretch test causes root tension of L2, L3, and L4 and may be a sign of disk herniations at the higher levels. This test has low sensitivity and specificity.\nNeurologic Tests\nNeurologic examination of the lower extremity should include measurement of knee and ankle reflexes and motor and sensory functions. Because over 90% of all nerve-related pathology in the lumbar spine occurs at the L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 levels, it is especially important to recognize the functions of the L4, L5, and S1 nerves (Table 15-2). The knee reflex is primarily a test of L4 nerve root function. Individuals with pathology at the L3-4 level may also have sensory changes in the L4 dermatome (Figure 15-1) and quadriceps weakness. L5 nerve root compression will often influence the strength of the extensor hallucis longus muscle, but other foot and ankle muscles can be affected as well, resulting in weakness in foot dorsiflexion and difficulty walking on the heels. The ankle reflex is primarily mediated by the S1 nerve root. Weakness in foot plantar flexion and difficulty with toe walking can also occur with S1 root compression. The Babinski sign and\nthe presence of clonus and hyperreflexia are important indicators of corticospinal tract involvement.\n\nChanges in balance and gait pattern may also signify myelopathy.\n\nA systematic neurologic examination can also localize the affected cervical nerve root (Table 15-2). The upper spine and extremity sensory dermatomes appear in Figure 15-2. The biceps (C5, partially C6), brachioradialis (C6), and triceps (C7) reflexes should\nL4\nbe elicited. Weakness of the deltoid and biceps muscles implicates C5; wrist extensors C6; triceps, wrist flexors, and finger extensors C7; finger flexors C8; and intrinsics C8 and T1. Sensation can be grossly evaluated by touch and more precisely determined by pinprick, light touch, and a vibrating fork.\nDermatomal overlap is common.\n\nReflexes should always be compared between extremities and elicited several times to determine reproducibility. Importantly, reflexes once \u201clost\u201d due to previous injury or disease rarely return. Strength should also be compared between extremities and may need repeat testing to determine effort and reproducibility.\n\n\n15.1 b Description of Clinical Studies\nGeneral\nThe individual may have undergone a variety of special tests including electromyographic, cystometric, roentgenographic studies with or without dye, CT scans, and MRI studies with or without contrast. The physician should determine when, where, and by whom the studies were done, the findings, and who interpreted them. Whenever possible, the physician should personally review the studies and report agreement or disagreement with previous interpretations. A summary of the studies should be included as a separate paragraph or section.\n\nWhile imaging and other studies may assist physicians in making a diagnosis, it is important to note that a positive imaging study in and of itself does not make the diagnosis. Several reports indicate approximately 30% of persons who have never had back pain will have an imaging study that can be interpreted as positive for a herniated disk, and 50% or more will have bulging disks. Further, the prevalence of degeneration changes, bulges, and herniations increases with advancing age.6-11 To be of diagnostic value, clinical symptoms and signs must agree with the imaging findings. In other words, an imaging test is useful to confirm a diagnosis, but an imaging result alone is insufficient to qualify for a DRE category. Individuals with electromyography (EMG) studies that are clearly positive support a diagnosis of radiculopathy and therefore qualify for at least DRE category III.14",
  "Section 148 - 3344 chars": "Motion Segment Integrity\nA motion segment of the spine is defined as two adjacent vertebrae, the intervertebral disk, the apophyseal or facet joints, and ligamentous structures between the vertebrae. The range of motion from segment to segment varies. In the upper cervical spine (occiput to C2), there is little flexionextension, while the lower cervical spine permits increasing flexion-extension movements from about 10\u00b0 at C2 to C3 to about 20\u00b0 at C5 to C6 and C6 to C7. Flexion-extension movements are about 4\u00b0 in the upper thoracic spine, 6\u00b0 in the midthoracic spine, and 12\u00b0 in the lower thoracic spine segments. In the lumbar spine there is a gradual increase from about 12\u00b0 at L1 to L2 to 20\u00b0 at the L5 to S1 level.13\n\nLateral bending is 5\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 in the lower cervical spine and about 6\u00b0 in the upper thoracic spine.\nIn the lumbar spine, lateral bending is greatest at L3 to L4, where it is about 8\u00b0 to 9\u00b0. Axial rotation is 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 in each direction in the upper cervical spine, 5\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 in the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, and minimal in the lumbar spine.\n\nThroughout the spine, movements are coupled; this means that the primary motion in one direction always is accompanied by a secondary motion in another direction. For example, rotation is almost always combined with side bending. The dominant motions at both the lower cervical and entire lumbar spine, where most clinical pathology occurs, are flexion-extension.\n\nAlteration of motion segment integrity can be either loss of motion segment integrity (increased translational or angular motion) or decreased motion resulting mainly from developmental changes, fusion, fracture healing, healed infection, or surgical arthrodesis. An attempt at arthrodesis may not necessarily result in a solid fusion, but it may significantly limit motion at a motion segment and qualify for alteration of motion segment integrity.\n\nA line is drawn along the posterior bodies of the vertebrae below and above the motion segment in question on dynamic (flexion and extension), lateral roentgenograms of the spine. The distance between lines A and B and the distance between lines B and C at the level of the posteroinferior corner of the upper vertebral body are summed. A value greater than 2.5 mm in the thoracic spine, greater than 4.5 mm in the lumbar spine, and greater than 3.5 mm in the cervical spine qualifies as loss of structural integrity.\n\nMotion of the individual spine segments cannot be determined by a physical examination but is evaluated with flexion and extension roentgenograms (see Figures 15-3a through 15-3c).13,14 Loss of motion segment integrity is defined as an anteroposterior motion of one vertebra over another that is greater than 3.5 mm in the cervical spine, greater than\n\n2.5 mm in the thoracic spine, and greater than 4.5 mm in the lumbar spine (Figure 15-3a). Loss of motion segment integrity is also defined as a difference in the angular motion of two adjacent motion segments greater than 15\u00b0 at L1-2, L2-3, and L3-4 and greater than 20\u00b0 at L4 to L5. Loss of integrity of the lumbosacral joint is defined as angular motion between L5 and S1 that is greater than 25\u00b0. In the cervical spine, loss of motion segment integrity is defined as motion at the level in question that is more than 11\u00b0 greater than at either adjacent level.",
  "Section 149 - 3059 chars": "When routine x-rays are normal and severe trauma is absent, motion segment alteration is rare; thus, flexion and extension x-rays are indicated only when the physician suspects motion segment alteration from history or findings on routine x-rays.14\n\n15.2\nDetermining the Appropriate Method for Assessment\nSpinal impairment rating is performed using one of two methods: the diagnosis-related estimate (DRE) or range-of-motion (ROM) method.\n\nThe DRE method is the principal methodology used to evaluate an individual who has had a distinct injury.When the cause of the impairment is not easily determined and if the impairment can be well characterized by the DRE method, the evaluator should use the DRE method.\n\nThe ROM method is used in several situations:\n\n1. When an impairment is not caused by an injury, if the cause of the condition is uncertain and the DRE method does not apply, or an individual cannot be easily categorized in a DRE class. It is acknowledged that the cause of impairment (injury, illness, or aging) cannot always be determined. The reason for using the ROM method under these circumstances must be carefully supported in writing.\n\nLines are drawn along the superior border of the vertebral body of the lower vertebrae and the superior border of the body of the upper vertebrae and the lines extended until they join. The angles are measured and subtracted. Note that lordosis (extension) is represented by a negative angle and kyphosis (flexion) by a positive angle. Loss of motion segment integrity is defined as motion greater than 15\u00b0 at L1-2, L2-3, and L3-4 and greater than 20\u00b0\nat L4 to L5. Loss of integrity of the lumbosacral joint is defined as angular motion between L5 and S1 that is greater than 25\u00b0. The flexion angle is +8\u00b0 and the extension angle is \u201318\u00b0. Therefore (+8) \u2013 (\u201318) = +26\u00b0 and would qualify for loss of structural integrity at any lumbar level.\n\nLines are drawn along the inferior borders of the two vertebral bodies adjacent to the level in question and of the vertebral bodies above and below those two vertebrae. Angles A, B, and C are measured on both flexion and extension x-rays and the measurements subtracted from one another. Note that lordosis (extension) is represented by a negative angle and kyphosis (flexion) is represented by a positive angle. Loss of motion segment integrity is defined as motion at the level in question that is more than 11\u00b0 greater than at either adjacent level.\n\n\n2. When there is multilevel involvement in the same spinal region (eg, fractures at multiple levels, disk herniations, or stenosis with radiculopathy at multiple levels or bilaterally).\n\n3. Where there is alteration of motion segment integrity (eg, fusions) at multiple levels in the same spinal region, unless there is involvement of the corticospinal tract (then use the DRE method for corticospinal tract involvement).\n\n4. Where there is recurrent radiculopathy caused by a new (recurrent) disk herniation or a recurrent injury in the same spinal region.",

Where there are multiple episodes of other pathology producing alteration of motion segment integrity and/or radiculopathy.\n\nThe ROM method can also be used if statutorily mandated in a particular jurisdiction.\n\nIn the small number of instances in which the ROM and DRE methods can both be used, evaluate the individual with both methods and award the higher rating.\n\nAll spine impairment ratings shown in Tables 15-3 to 15-5 estimate whole person impairment. With both the DRE method and the ROM method, whole person function is regarded as 100%. For converting whole person to regional spine impairments, see Section 15.13. When two or more regions are impaired and rated by either the DRE or ROM method, the ratings should be combined using the Combined Values Chart, p. 604.\n\nA flowchart of the spine impairment evaluation process is provided in Figure 15-4.\n\n\n15.2 a Summary of Specific Procedures and Directions\n\n1. Take a careful history, perform a thorough medical examination, and review all pertinent records and studies. This is helpful in determining the presence or absence of structural abnormalities, nerve root or cord involvement, and motion segment integrity.\n\n2. Consider the permanency of the impairment, referring to Guides Chapter 1 and the Glossary for definitions as needed. If the impairment is resolving, changing, unstable, or expected to change significantly with or without medical treatment within 12 months, it is not considered a permanent (stable) impairment and should not be rated under the Guides criteria.\n\n3.\nSelect the region that is primarily involved (ie, the lumbar, cervical, or thoracic spine) and identify the individual\u2019s most serious objective findings.\n\n4. Determine whether the individual has multilevel involvement or multiple recurrences/occasions within the same region of the spine. Use the ROM method if:\na. there are fractures at more than one level in a spinal region,\nb. there is radiculopathy bilaterally or at multiple levels in the same spinal region,\nc. there is multilevel motion segment alteration (such as a multilevel fusion) in the same spinal region, or\nd. there is recurrent disk herniation or stenosis with radiculopathy at the same or a different level in the same spinal region; in this case, combine the ratings using the ROM method.\n\n\n5. If the individual does not have multilevel involvement or multiple recurrences/occasions and an injury occurred, determine the proper DRE category. Most ratings will fall into categories I, II, or III. A corticospinal tract injury is evaluated according to Section 15.7.\n\n6. If the individual has been treated with surgery or another modality, evaluate the results, extent of improvement, and impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living. If residual symptoms or objective findings impact the ability to perform ADL despite treatment, the higher percentage in each range should be assigned. If an individual had a prior condition, was asymptomatic, and now\u2014at MMI\u2014has symptoms that impact the ability to perform activities of daily living, the higher rating within a range may also be used. If ratings are increased, explicit documentation of the reasons for the increase should be included in the report.",
  "Section 151 - 3181 chars": "7. If more than one spine region is impaired, determine the impairment of the other region(s) with the DRE method. Combine the regional impairments using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) to express the individual\u2019s total spine impairment.\n\n8. From historical information and previously compiled medical data, determine if there was a preexisting impairment. Congenital, developmental, and other preexisting conditions may be differentiated from those attributable to the injury or illness by examining preinjury roentgenograms or by performing a bone scan after the onset of the condition.\n\n9.\nIf requested, apportion findings to the current or prior condition, following jurisdiction practices and assuming adequate information is available on the prior condition. In some instances, to apportion ratings, the percent impairment due to previous findings can simply be subtracted from the percent based on the current findings. Ideally, use the same method to compare the individual\u2019s prior and present conditions. If the ROM method has been used previously, it must be used again. If the previous evaluation was based on the DRE method and the individual now is evaluated with the ROM method, and prior ROM measurements do not exist to calculate a ROM impairment rating, the previous DRE percent can be subtracted from the ROM ratings. Because there are two methods and complete data may not exist on an earlier assessment, the apportionment calculation may be a less than ideal estimate.\n\n10. For individuals with corticospinal tract involvement, refer to Table 15-6 for the appropriate impairment rating.\n\n\n15.3 Diagnosis-Related Estimates Method\n\nThe DRE method has eight diagnosis-related categories for each of the three spinal regions. In assigning the individual to the correct DRE category, one of two approaches is used. The first is based on symptoms, signs, and appropriate diagnostic test results. The second is based on the presence of fractures and/or dislocations with or without clinical symptoms. If a fracture is present that places the individual into a DRE category, no other verification is required. The symptoms, signs other than fractures, and tests used to assist correct categorization of an individual are defined in Box 15-1.\n\nTo use the DRE method, obtain an individual\u2019s history, examine the individual, review the results of appropriate diagnostic studies, and place the individual in the appropriate category. Although there are eight categories, almost all individuals will fall into one of the first three DRE categories. Altered motion segment integrity (ie, increased motion or loss of motion) qualifies the individual for category IV or V. A fracture and/or dislocation, with or without clinical symptoms, permits placement of the individual into a DRE category with no additional verification. If there are impairments in different spinal regions, rate each spinal region separately using the DRE method; then combine the ratings using the Combined Values Chart on page 604. As stated previously, fractures at more than one level in the same spinal region should be rated using the ROM method.",
  "Section 152 - 3632 chars": "In most cases, using the definitions provided in Box 15-1, the physician can assign an individual to DRE category I, II, or III. An individual in category I has only subjective findings. In category II, the individual has objective findings but no radiculopathy or alteration of structural integrity, while in category III, radiculopathy with objective verification must be present. Since an individual is evaluated after having reached MMI, a previous history of objective findings may not define the current, ratable condition but is important in determining the course and whether\n\nMMI has been reached. The impairment rating is based on the condition once MMI is reached, not on prior symptoms or signs.\n\nIf the individual had a radiculopathy caused by a herniated disk or lateral spinal stenosis that responded to conservative treatment and currently has no radicular symptoms or signs, he or she is placed in category II, since at MMI there is no radiculopathy. Category III is for individuals with a symptomatic radiculopathy, either after medical or surgical treatment, or for individuals who have a history of previous radiculopathy caused by disk herniation or lateral spinal stenosis but have improved or become asymptomatic following surgery.\n\nThe DRE method recommends that physicians document physiologic and structural impairments relating to injuries or diseases other than common developmental findings, such as (1) spondylolysis, found normally in 7% of adults; (2) spondylolisthesis, found in 3% of adults; (3) herniated disk without radiculopathy, found in approximately 30% of individuals by age 40 years; and (4) aging changes, present in 40% of adults after age 35 years and in almost all individuals after age 50.6,12 As previously noted, the presence of these abnormalities on imaging studies does not necessarily mean the individual has an impairment due to an injury.\n\nIn cases where the abnormalities discussed above are present on imaging studies and are known or assumed to have preexisted an injury being rated, physicians should acknowledge these antecedent conditions. If requested, physicians may need to assess whether the condition was previously symptomatic and whether any aggravation occurred as a result of the injury.\nPhysicians should be aware of the statutory definition in the involved jurisdiction pertaining to aggravation to ensure their use of the term is consistent with their state\u2019s legal interpretation.\n\nDRE categories are discussed in the following three sections.\n\n15.4\n\n: Lumbar Spine\nThe lumbar spine DRE categories are summarized in Table 15-3. Apart from category I, each category includes a range to account for the resolution or continuation of symptoms and their impact on the ability to perform ADL.\n\nFor thoracic spine problems localized to the thoracic region, use Table 15-4. If the thoracic pathology also leads to isolated bowel or bladder dysfunction not due to corticospinal damage, obtain the appropriate estimates for bowel and bladder dysfunction listed in the gastrointestional and urology chapters and combine these with the thoracic spine DRE category (I-V) listed in Table 15-4. If the thoracic spine problem is due to corticospinal tract involvement, use Section 15.7. If thoracic injury\u2013related bowel or bladder symptoms exist without verifiable lower extremity involvement, then appropriate estimates for bowel and bladder impairments from the Guides chapters on the urinary and reproductive and digestive systems should be combined (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) with an impairment percent from one of the thoracic categories II through V.",

If the cervical spine problem also leads to isolated bowel and/or bladder dysfunction not due to corticospinal damage, obtain the appropriate estimates for bowel and\n\nbladder dysfunction from the gastrointestinal and urology chapters (Chapters 6 and 7) and combine these with the appropriate cervical spine DRE category from DRE I to V, listed in Table 15-5. If the cervical spine problem is due to corticospinal tract involvement, use Table 15-6 alone.\n\nThe DRE cervical categories are summarized in Table 15-5.\n\nFigure 15-5 illustrates the relationship of nerve roots to the vertebral level.\n\nThe level at which nerve roots exit the spine relative to the vertebrae. The neurologic level of involvement is determined by identifying the lowest normally functioning nerve root.\n\nIn prior editions of the Guides, rating spinal cord injury was done either through a combination of DRE categories or in the nervous system chapter. It was decided in this edition to evaluate spinal cord injuries based on the criteria in the nervous system chapter (Chapter 13). These criteria are repeated in this section. For bilateral neurologic or corticospinal tract damage, consultation with a spinal cord injury specialist and review of Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System, is recommended. Thus, for an individual with a spinal cord injury affecting the upper extremities, use Table 15-6 and the appropriate impairment rating for impairment of one or both upper extremities. For impairments involving loss of use of the lower extremities, use the section in Table 15-6 pertaining to station and gait impairment. If there is additional bowel or bladder dysfunction, combine the upper extremity or lower extremity loss with impairments in bladder, anorectal, and/or neurologic sexual impairment as warranted.\n\nOnce a class has been selected, the exact value is obtained by combining the value with the corresponding additional impairment from DRE categories II through V for cervical and lumbar impairment and DRE categories II through IV for thoracic impairment. An exact value is determined based on the degree of impairment of ADL. Table 15-6 and the following examples illustrate the method for impairment rating of spinal cord injury.\n\nAll impairment estimates shown in the tables of this section are expressed as whole person impairments. Section 15.13 explains how to express a whole person spine impairment as a regional spine impairment. Tables 15-8 through 15-14 provide estimates for rating ankylosis and range of motion, while neurologic impairments are rated based on Tables 15-15 through 15-18. The data on standards and normal functioning described in this section are based on both medical studies and consensus judgments.15,18-27",
  "Section 154 - 3471 chars": "As previously stated (Section 15.2) the ROM method should be used only (1) if the DRE method is not applicable (no verifiable injury); (2) if, after obtaining the history and performing the examination, the physician cannot place the individual within a multilevel DRE category; (3) if multilevel involvement and/or alteration of motion segment integrity has occurred in the same spinal region; (4) if there is recurrent radiculopathy caused by a new (recurrent) disk herniation or a recurrent injury in the same spinal region; (5) if there are multiple episodes of other pathology producing alteration of motion segment integrity and/or radiculopathy; or (6) if statutorily mandated by the involved jurisdiction.\n\nConcerns have been raised by users of the Guides regarding perceived ageand gender-related variations in the normal population, which may bias impairments in favor of males or older individuals, both of whom are perceived to be less flexible and therefore may be judged \u201cimpaired\u201d even under normal circumstances. Since preparation of the fourth edition, some scientific evidence has accumulated and several relevant articles have been identified.27-45\n\nRegarding gender, the scientific evidence is inconsistent. The majority of studies actually show a nonsignificant trend toward greater motion for male normal individuals in each age group. The only movement showing any statistically significant gender difference is cervical extension, and then only in younger women. This finding is inconsistent among various studies, however, and the difference disappears with advancing age.35,41\n\nThere is a decrease in normal motion with advancing age, but the effect is not linear. Most studies examining a wide spectrum of age groups find greater alterations in mobility below 20 and above 60 years of age. Several studies suggest that lifestyle factors may influence flexibility far more than inherent factors, as the variability of overall motion between individuals increases with advancing years. However, the evidence is inconsistent, and the changes in normative data too small for the most relevant age groups 20 to 59, to warrant age adjustment in this edition of the Guides.\n\n\n15.8 a General ROM Method Measurement Principles\nImpairment should be evaluated when the condition has stabilized after completion of all necessary medical, surgical, and rehabilitative treatment. This principle precludes rating an acute illness or injury. For example, if acute muscle spasm is present, this should be noted in the examiner\u2019s report; however, the mobility measurements would not be valid for estimating permanent impairment. Because the Guides only considers permanent impairment, rating should be deferred until after any acute exacerbation of the chronic condition has subsided, ie, when the individual is at MMI (see Chapter 1 and the Glossary).\n\nPain, fear of injury, disuse, or neuromuscular inhibition may limit mobility by diminishing the individual\u2019s effort, leading to inaccurately low and inconsistent measurements. The physician should seek consistency when testing active motion, strength, and sensation. Tests with inconsistent results should be repeated. Results that remain inconsistent should be disregarded. When the physiologic measurements fail to match known pathology, they should be repeated and, if still inconsistent, disallowed until documented evidence is provided for the abnormalities noted on the physical examination.",
  "Section 155 - 3486 chars": "The reproducibility (precision) of an individual\u2019s performance is one (but not the sole) indicator of optimum effort. When measuring range of motion, the examiner should obtain at least three consecutive measurements and calculate the mean (average) of the three. Measurements should not change substantially with repeated efforts. If the average is less than 50\u00b0, three consecutive measurements must fall within 5\u00b0 of the mean; if the average is greater than 50\u00b0, three consecutive measurements must fall within 10% of the mean. Motion testing may be repeated up to six times to obtain three consecutive measurements that meet these criteria. If after six measurements inconsistency persists, the spinal motions are considered invalid. The measurements and accompanying impairment estimates may then be disallowed, in part or in their entirety.\n\nThere are multiple potential sources of error in a quantitative physical examination.17,20,21 The greatest source of error that occurs is due to test administrator inexperience or lack of knowledge. The evaluator should also ensure adequate warm-up movements have been performed.16 When possible, the individual being evaluated should warm up prior to the ROM measurements: flexion and extension twice, left and right rotation twice, left and right lateral bending twice, and one additional flexion and extension. The warm-up movements do not need to be repeated before each subsequent test of motions of the same spinal region.\n\nThe physician also needs to ensure the anatomical landmarks are accurate, the body part is stabilized, the measurement device is properly stabilized on the spine, and appropriate instructions are provided to the individual.17,20,21 If these principles are followed, errors due to examination technique, the measurement device itself, or normal human variability will be minimized.\n\n\n15.8 b Principles of Inclinometry and Spine Motion Measurement\nSince spinal motion is compound, it is essential to measure simultaneously motion of both the upper and lower extremes of the spine region being examined. Because the small joints of the spine do not lend themselves readily to two-arm goniometric measurements and measuring a spine segment\u2019s mobility is confounded by motion above and below the assessed points, an inclinometer is the preferred device for obtaining accurate, reproducible measurements in a simple, practical, and inexpensive way.\nThe subcutaneous bony structures that mark the upper and lower ends of the three spine regions can be palpated readily.\n\nInclinometers, also called angle finders or level indicators, are small angle-measuring devices traditionally used by carpenters, mechanics, and tradespeople. Recently, physicians, therapists, and veterinarians have used them to measure angles and ranges of motion in humans and animals. Inclinometers work like a plumb line, operating on the principle of gravity, which is a constant. An inclinometer used by a physician should be marked off in 2\u00b0 increments or less and in good operating condition (Figure15-6). A mechanical inclinometer has a starting or 0\u00b0 position indicated by a weighted needle or pendulum. A fluid level can cause errors in reading the meniscus. A fluid-filled inclinometer should allow rotation of its inclinometer face so any number on the face can be set as the initial position. Electronic inclinometers use gravity sensors to determine an angle from the vertical, and then perform internal calculations.21",
  "Section 156 - 3050 chars": "Features of a properly designed inclinometer for medical use include a dial large enough to allow easy reading of 2\u00b0 increments but small enough to enable application on the spine and all joints of the body; features to enable repeated, accurate application and stabilization of the instrument on the body; and a dial that can both display the 0\u00b0 gravity position and be set by the examiner to a 0\u00b0 starting position when the body part cannot be placed in a 0\u00b0 gravity or neutral position.\n\nBox 15-2 offers a partial list of companies that produce or distribute inclinometers. The American Medical Association does not endorse or recommend any particular type or brand of inclinometer.\n\nThe following principles, discussed in greater detail by Mayer,17 by Gerhardt et al,20,21 and in forthcoming AMA educational material, are important to follow to obtain accurate measurements.\n\nGravitational plane. An inclinometer works only in the vertical position because only that plane allows the pointer or sensor to move freely in response to gravity. An inclinometer will not operate properly if tilted or at all when horizontal. Therefore, the individual being examined must be in a position that permits motion of the part being tested in a vertical plane. For spinal measurements in the sagittal and frontal (coronal) planes the individual should be standing or sitting, with the spine vertical (Figure\n\n15-7). Measurements in the transverse or axial plane must be made with the individual in the supine, prone, or flexed hip position.\n\nMeasure spinal ROM in three principal planes: sagittal (extension-flexion), frontal or coronal, and transverse or axial (rotation) (Figure 15-7). If a spinal region has two or more impaired motions, the ratings for each range of motion impairment are added.\nImpairments of two or more regions of the spine are\ncombined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\nStabilization. If the caudad (superior), or lower, part of a spine region can be stabilized so it does not move when the superior, or upper, part moves, a single mechanical inclinometer may be used, as with measuring cervical rotation (see Figure 15-17).\nHowever, two inclinometers are usually needed to measure most movements of the spine. Single electronic inclinometers use microprocessors to duplicate functions of mechanical inclinometers. Their use\nwill not be described in detail here as information is available from the manufacturer. The user should ensure that the features described above are addressed.\n\n\n15.8c Ankylosis and Motion With Ankylosis\nAnkylosis is defined as the complete absence of joint motion and is expressed as a fixed position. In the spine, which has multiple motion segments in each region with vertebrae moving together and separately, complete absence of regional motion is rare. For spine impairment evaluation only, when an individual cannot reach the neutral (0\u00b0) position, the position or angle of restriction closest to neutral is considered the position of ankylosis or end-restricted movement.",
  "Section 157 - 3002 chars": "If the individual has end-restricted movement, this value, taken as the ankylosis value, is used to determine impairment instead of the ROM. If the motion crosses the neutral position in any plane, the examiner should use the abnormal motion section of the appropriate table to determine the impairment for that plane.\n\nS: sagittal plane, T: transverse plane, F: frontal or coronal plane.\n\nManual pressure during use. The inclinometer should be held so it remains firmly applied to the subcutaneous skeletal structure while the spine is moving through the entire range of motion. It must not deviate from the original position because of skin movement or uneven pressure on the skin overlying the bony landmark, which might occur with an obese individual. The inclinometer design is important to allow proper application and avoid slippage on subcutaneous bony prominences. Firm contact of two points of the instrument with the structure is essential, especially if a convex surface such as the sacrum or calvarium (top of the head) is involved.\n\nRecording ROM Measurements\nROM measurements can be recorded on the summary sheets (Figures 15-10, 15-15, and 15-18).\n\nIn determining ankylosis impairments, the examiner should add the ankylosis impairments in several planes within a single region or combine the ankylosis impairments of two or more regions (Combined Values Chart, p. 604). If a spinal region has several range-of-motion impairments and an ankylosis impairment, the ROM impairments are added and the total is combined with the ankylosis impairment.\nImpairments of two or more regions are always combined (Combined Values Chart).\n\n\n15.8d Estimating Whole Person Impairment Using the ROM Method\n\n1. Determine whether the individual has reached MMI and the impairment is stable. If the condition is changing or likely to improve substantially with medical treatment, the impairment is not permanent and should not be rated. If it is permanent, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. Select the impaired region: cervical, thoracic, or lumbar.\n\n3. Use Table 15-7 to determine the percentage impairment for the part of the ROM diagnosis\u2013 based method. If there are two or more diagnoses within a spinal region, use that which is most significant. This percent will be combined with those for the impaired range(s) of motion and the whole person neurologic deficit (steps 7-9 below).\n\n\n4. Measure the range of motion in the relevant sagittal, frontal (coronal), and transverse planes (Figure 15-7), and determine any angle of ankylosis or any restricted motion that is present.\n\n5. Perform at least three measurements of each motion. Determine which measurements meet reproducibility criteria described under general measurement principles described in Section\n\n15.8b.

If the measurements do not meet the consistency requirements described in step 5, perform additional tests until the reproducibility criteria are satisfied, up to a maximum of six. If the test results remain inconsistent after six measurements, repeat the tests at a later date or disallow impairment related to that motion.\n\n7. Use the maximum motion from a reproducible set of measurements to determine any impairment rating from the appropriate tables, based on the spinal region and type of movement. Refer to Section 15.8c, Ankylosis and Motion With Ankylosis, if there are several range-ofmotion or ankylosis impairments in a region. For example, an individual who can flex the cervical spine from 30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 but who lacks 30\u00b0 of motion in reaching the neutral 0\u00b0 position has restricted end motion and the same estimated impairment as if he or she had fixed ankylosis at 30\u00b0 of cervical flexion. According to Table 1512, the individual\u2019s impairment is 30% of the whole person. If there are impairments due to loss of motion in more than one plane in the same spinal region (extension, flexion, or rotation), the impairments are added to determine total impairment due to loss of motion in a spinal region.\n\n8. Determine any impairments due to neurologic deficits, such as radiculopathy or spinal nerve injury. Refer to Table 15-15 for the procedure to evaluate the sensory deficit. Use Table 15-16 to determine the procedure for estimating loss of strength. Apply these tables to Table 15-17 (cervical and thoracic nerve roots) or Table 15-18 (lumbar and sacral nerve roots) as needed. Convert the neurologic impairments, initially calculated as upper or lower extremity, into a whole person impairment.\n\n9.\nCombine the diagnosis-based (Table 15-7) and physical examination\u2013based (mobility and neurologic) impairment percents using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\n10.

Provide information about the test and allow warm-up within pain tolerance. Warm-up exercises, as described in Section 15.8a, are done as tolerated by the individual, based on physician judgment.\n\n2. The individual should be standing with knees extended and weight balanced on both feet, ideally with hands on hips for support to permit greater motion. The spine should be in the neutral position while the inclinometers are set at 0\u00b0 (See Figure 15-8a). Locate and place horizontal skin marks\n\nover the T12 spinous process and the sacrum. Center the first inclinometer aligned in the sagittal plane, over the mark for the T12 spinous process. Center the second inclinometer over the sacral horizontal mark. It is generally best to place the sacral mark at the midpoint of the posterior superior iliac spine because if the mark is placed too high on the sacral convexity, the inclinometer may be displaced during extension. Be certain of the bony landmarks.\n\n3. Instruct the individual to flex the trunk as far as possible (Figure 15-8b), again recording both inclinometer angles and subtracting the sacral (hip) from the T12 inclinometer angle to obtain true lumbar flexion angle. Ask the individual to return the trunk to the neutral position.\n\n\n4. Ask the individual to extend maximally while holding the inclinometers firmly, and record both angles (Figure 15-8c). Subtract the sacral (hip) inclination from the T12 inclinometer angle to obtain the true lumbar extension angle. Return the trunk to the neutral position (verify that the inclinometers are still at 0\u00b0).\n\n5. Repeat the procedure at least three times and at most six times for flexion and extension to obtain a valid measurement set (three consecutive, reproducible measurements). Only the true lumbar spine flexion and extension angles need to be consistently measured within 5\u00b0 if the average is less than 50\u00b0, or within 10\u00b0 if the average is greater than 50\u00b0. The impairment is based on the maximum true extension and flexion angles from within the three measurements. The average of the three is only used to determine consistency.\n\n6. An accessory validity test can be performed for lumbosacral flexion and extension.35 In this test, record the straight-leg-raising angle of the supine individual by placing an inclinometer on each tibial crest with the knees extended and the hip flexed (Figure 15-8d). Compare the straight-leg-raising angle to the sum of the sacral flexion and extension (sacral or hip motion) angles (Figures 15-9a and 15-9c). If the straight-leg-raising angle exceeds the sum of sacral flexion and extension angles by more than 15\u00b0, the lumbosacral flexion test is invalid. Normally, the straight-leg-",
  "Section 160 - 3388 chars": "raising angle is about the same as the sum of the sacral flexion-extension angle.

At these levels or above, the difference between sacral motion and supine straight leg raising will usually exceed 15\u00b0 because the hamstring and gluteal muscles are contracted in the standing flexed position and relaxed in the supine position. However, below the threshold of 65\u00b0 for women and 55\u00b0 for men, the tightest supine straight-leg-raising angle should not be more than 15\u00b0 greater than the combined sacral (hip) flexion and extension angle in the standing position.\n\na. neutral position\nb. lateral bending\n\n\n4. Instruct the individual to bend the trunk to the right as far as possible (Figure 15-9b), again recording both inclinometer angles and subtracting the sacral (hip) angle from the T12 inclinometer angle to obtain the lumbar right lateral bending angle. Ask the individual to return to the neutral position.\n\n5. Repeat the procedure at least three times per side. To be valid, three of six consecutive measurements must lie within 5\u00b0 or 10% of the mean, whichever is greater. The impairment estimate is based on the highest (least impairing) angle of a valid set. The mean is used only for a test of reproducibility.\n\nWith measurements for left and right lateral bending and any ankylosis, use Table 15-9 to determine the whole person impairment.\n\nAdd the impairments within the lumbar region. If other regions are impaired, the lumbar impairment should be combined with the other region impairment using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\nPhysical Exam: Measured T12 angles for left lateral bending are 20\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, and 25\u00b0. Corresponding sacral (hip) lateral flexion measurements to the right are 15\u00b0, 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, and 10\u00b0. Subtracting the sacral bending measurements, the true lumbosacral left lateral flexion angles are 5\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 20\u00b0, and 15\u00b0, respectively. The first measurement is discarded, being more than 5\u00b0 less than the mean of 13.75\u00b0, but the next three measurements fulfill reproducibility criteria. The best left lateral bending angle is 20\u00b0.\nDiagnosis: Chronic low back pain.\nImpairment Rating: 1% impairment due to loss of left lateral bending (Table 15-9). Obtain the other ROM measurements for the lumbar spine and add the ROM impairments.\n\nAnkylosis\nAnkylosis in lumbar spine lateral bending (flexion) is generally associated with a scoliosis and usually produces only limited impairment. Mark the T12 and spinous process and sacrum, and ask the individual to stand in the most erect position possible that corrects the deformity. Using measurements made in the frontal (coronal) plane, subtract the sacral (hip) inclination from the T12 inclination and record the ankylosis angle or the angle of restriction (closest to the 0\u00b0 neutral position).

The amount of extension is determined mainly by the individual\u2019s posture and the degree of fixed kyphosis or curvature of the thoracic spine. To determine the ranges of motion of this region, the individual is measured in the military brace posture to obtain the angle of extension or minimum kyphosis. Then, with the individual fully flexing the thoracic spine, the flexion angle is determined. The angle of minimum kyphosis is actually a measure of ankylosis, and impairment resulting from deformity corresponding to this angle is found in the Ankylosis part of Table 15-10.\n\nTwo-Inclinometer Technique\n\n1.

Place both inclinometers, which do not show gravity 0 automatically against a true vertical surface, such as a wall, and set the neutral 0\u00b0 positions. Place the inclinometers over the T1 and T12 spinous processes while instructing the individual to maintain the maximally extended military brace posture position (Figures 15-11a and 15-11c). Subtract the T12 inclinometer reading from the T1 inclinometer reading (if both are inclined in the same direction from the vertical) to obtain the angle of minimum kyphosis. If T12 and T1 are inclined in opposite directions from the vertical, add the angles. Find the impairment percent in the Ankylosis part of Table 15-10.\n\n3.\nSet the inclinometers to 0\u00b0 with the individual standing in the erect military brace posture. Then ask the individual to fully flex the thoracic spine. Flexing at the hips is permitted. Subtract the T12 inclinometer reading from the T1 reading obtained in step 1 above to obtain the angle of thoracic flexion (Figures 15-11b and 15-11d).\n\n4. Repeat either the sitting or the standing test up to six times to obtain three measurements within 5\u00b0 of the mean or 10%, whichever is greater.\n\n5. A reproducibility test is done after a positional change, having the standing individual sit or vice versa. If the initial measurements were made standing, seat the individual on a stool, record the neutral 0\u00b0 position, and ask him or her to flex the thoracic spine maximally from the military brace position. The thoracic flexion sitting angle should be nearly identical to the flexion angle obtained in the erect position.\n\n6. Consult the Abnormal Motion part of Table 15-10 to determine the whole person impairment.\n\nAnkylosis\nThe angle of minimum kyphosis of the thoracic spine may be considered equal to the angle of ankylosis.

In the thoracic spine, spinal cord compression or injury may produce long tract signs, but nerve roots are uncommonly compressed. In the lumbosacral spine, spinal cord involvement is rare because the cord typically ends at L1, although nerve root compression (cauda equina or isolated root[s]) affecting the lower extremities is common. If any neural impairment is identified, proceed with the following evaluation:",

Find the maximum impairment due to nerve dysfunction in Table 15-17 for the upper extremity and Table 15-18 for the lower extremity.\n\n4. Multiply the severity of the sensory or motor deficit by the maximum value of the relevant nerve (Tables 15-17, 15-18). If there is both sensory and motor impairment of a nerve root, the impairment percents are combined (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to determine the extremity impairment. If both extremities are impaired, the impairment percent for each extremity is determined, converted to whole person impairment, and the two impairment ratings combined using the Combined Values Chart.\n\n\n5. Convert to whole person impairment by multiplying the upper extremity impairment by 0.6 and the lower extremity impairment by 0.4. To convert any regional ROM spine impairment to whole person impairment, multiply the specific spinal nerve impairment by the regional weight: 0.80 for the cervical spine, 0.40 for the thoracic spine, and 0.90 for the lumbosacral spine. Impairment ratings above 100% are rounded down to 100% since a whole person impairment rating cannot exceed 100%. This is described further in Section 15.14.\n\nIf there is bilateral spinal nerve impairment or spinal cord involvement, especially if in conjunction with head injury, consultation with a neurologist and/or neurosurgeon and review of the diagnostic criteria in the neurology chapter (Chapter 13) is advisable. The physician should decide whether evaluation by the spine or neurology chapter criteria is most appropriate.\n\n\n15.13 Criteria for\nConverting Whole Person Impairment to Regional Spine Impairment\nIn some instances, the evaluator may be asked to express an impairment rating in terms of the involved spine region rather than the whole person. This is done by dividing the whole person impairment estimate by the percent of spine function that has been assigned to that region. Under the DRE method, a whole person estimate being converted to a regional estimate would be divided by 0.35 for the cervical spine, 0.20 for the\n\nthoracic spine, and 0.75 for the lumbar and sacral spines. Under the ROM method, a whole person estimate being converted to a regional estimate should be divided by 0.80 for the cervical spine, 0.40 for the thoracic spine, or 0.90 for the lumbosacral spine (Figure 15-19). For example, a 24-year-old female office worker sustained a cervical injury that, after it was healed and stable, resulted in a whole body impairment, estimated by the DRE method, of 20%.\nDividing the 20% by 0.35 results in 57% impairment of the cervical spine. An individual with multiple lumbar compression fractures was rated 25% whole body impairment by the ROM method. To obtain an estimate of lumbar spine impairment, the physician should divide the 25% by 0.9, resulting in a 27.7% rounded up to 28% lumbar spine impairment. Any values that exceed 100% are rounded down to 100% regional impairment.",

The methods discussed in this chapter for evaluation of upper extremity impairment due to amputation, sensory loss, and abnormal motion or ankylosis were based on A. B. Swanson\u2019s work and adapted from the fourth edition and updated with input from many of the specialty societies listed in the preface.\n\nThe following revisions have been made for the fifth edition: (1) basic principles of assessment have been clarified, (2) updates of the latest scientific information in assessment of upper extremity impairments have been provided, (3) measurement of range of motion of the fingers has been clarified to also detect limited motion due to limited excursion of tendons,\n(4) impairment determination for nerve entrapment syndromes has been clarified, (5) the criteria for diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome are discussed and consistent throughout the book,\n(6) criteria for diagnosis and rating of carpal instability have been clarified, and (7) criteria for diagnosis and rating of weakness not due to other ratable conditions have been clarified.\n\n16.1 Principles of Assessment\n\n16.1 a Principles of Impairment Evaluation Before using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.",
  "Section 166 - 3552 chars": "Methods for evaluating impairments of the upper extremities may be described as having anatomic, cosmetic, or functional bases. The physical evaluation determines the anatomic impairment and is based on the history and a detailed examination of the individual and the upper extremity(ies). The cosmetic evaluation concerns both the individual\u2019s and society\u2019s reaction to the individual\u2019s condition. The functional evaluation measures the individual\u2019s motor performance of activities of daily living or of a specific task within a set time frame. Functional studies are increasingly sophisticated and can complement the evaluation process. However, the necessary level of standardization in precision and reproducibility to assess function has not yet been developed to derive a numeric impairment rating.\nTherefore, evaluation of anatomic impairment forms the basis for upper extremity assessment. The impairment ratings originally developed and retained in this chapter were developed to reflect the degree of impairment and its impact on the ability of the individual to perform activities of daily living.\n\nThe most practical and useful approach to evaluating impairment of a digit is to compare the current loss of function with the loss resulting from amputation. Total loss of motion and sensibility of a digit, or ankylosis with severe malposition that renders the digit essentially useless, is considered to be about the same as amputation of the part. Ankylosis of a digit or joint in the optimal functional position is given the least motion impairment of the part. Impairment due to total transverse sensory loss of a digit corresponds to 50% of the amputation impairment at the same length or level of involvement (Figures 16-6 and\n\n16-7). Impairment values derived from amputation, loss of motion or ankylosis, and sensibility loss are combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\n\n16.1 b Impairment Evaluation: Documentation and Recording\nThe medical evaluation is the basis for determination of permanent anatomic impairment of the upper extremities. It must be accurate, objective, and well documented. Evaluation of the upper extremities requires a sound knowledge of the normal functional anatomy and would be incomplete without assessment of the general condition of the whole person.\nIt must be thorough and should include several elements: status of activities of daily living; careful observations; both local and general physical examinations; appropriate imaging evaluation; laboratory tests; and, preferably, a photographic record.\n\nThe Upper Extremities\n\n435\n\nAn impairment evaluation is based on the examiner\u2019s actual findings. A prior injury or illness is considered during assessment of causation and apportionment, as discussed in Chapters 1 and 2. Impairment ratings in this chapter have not been adjusted for hand dominance, as is done in Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System. Hand dominance is difficult to objectively measure and is not accounted for in these impairment ratings. Hand dominance may be right or left and may be marked or slight, or the individual may be completely ambidextrous. Hand dominance should be considered in the determination of disability. If the examiner believes that hand dominance has a significant impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living, this can be discussed in the impairment evaluation report along with the resulting impairment rating. Hand dominance may, of course, be significant when assessing disability.",
  "Section 167 - 3384 chars": "A complete and detailed examination of the upper extremities is necessary for accurate impairment evaluation. One method for recording results from a systematic examination is the use of the Upper Extremity Impairment Evaluation Record (Figures 16-1a and 16-1b). Part 1 of the evaluation record addresses the hand region and lists impairments due to abnormal motion or ankylosis, amputation, and sensory loss resulting from digital nerve lesions and to other disorders. Part 2 is designed to assist impairment evaluation of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder due to abnormal motion or ankylosis, amputation, and \u201cother\u201d disorders, as well as those related to the peripheral nerve system, peripheral vascular system, and other disorders not included in regional impairments (eg, grip strength). Table 16-1 gives conversions from digit to hand impairment, and Table 16-2 gives those from hand to upper extremity impairment. Regional impairments resulting from the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder regions are combined to provide the upper extremity impairment (see Section 1.4, Philosophy and Use of the Combined Values Chart, and the Combined Values Chart, p. 604). The upper extremity impairment is then converted to a whole person impairment by means of Table 16-3.\nWhen to add as opposed to combine impairments is discussed in Sections 16.1c and 16.1d and noted in Figure 16-1.\n\nThe impairment evaluation record form is designed for use with unilateral upper extremity impairments. Cases of bilateral involvement require completion of a separate record form for each upper extremity. The whole person impairment values derived for each upper extremity are then combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) to derive the total whole person impairment. If the total combined whole person impairment does not seem to adequately reflect the actual extent of alteration in the individual\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living, this should be noted.\n\u2022 Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\u2020Use Table 16-2 (hand to upper extremity).\n\u00a7Use Table 16-3.

Similarly, multiple regional impairments, such as those of the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder, are first expressed individually as upper extremity impairments and then combined to determine the total upper extremity impairment. The latter is finally converted to whole person impairment (Table 16-3). The combined value determination is based on the following formula: A% + B% (100% \u2013 A%) = the combined value of A% and B%.",
  "Section 168 - 3070 chars": "The Combined Values Chart (p. 604) is used to determine the combined value of two impairment percentages. All percentages being combined must be expressed on a common denominator or same unit relative value. If three or more values are to be combined, the two lowest values are first selected and their combined value is found. The combined value and the third value are then combined to give the total value. This procedure can be repeated indefinitely, with the value obtained in each case being a combination of all the previous values.\n\n\n4. For each unit of motion, the motion impairment value is found by adding together the two impairment values contributed by its components, based on the formula A% = E% + F%. Similarly, for each joint, the total motion impairment rating is found by adding the impairment values contributed by each unit of motion. For example, the upper extremity impairment due to abnormal elbow motion is found by adding the impairments from the flexion + extension (IE% + IF%) unit to those from the pronation + supination (IP% + IS%) unit, or total motion impairment equals (IF% + IE%) + (IP% + IS%).\n\n5. In Section 16.7, Impairment of the Upper Extremities Due to Other Disorders, the relative value of each joint has been assigned on a 100% digit unit scale: thumb CMC 60%, MP 15%, and IP 25%; and finger MP 50%, PIP 30%, and DIP 20% (Table 16-18). However, the relative value scale used in Table 16-18 is not the same as that assigned for amputations (Table 16-4) and range of motion. Therefore, if more than one joint of a specific digit is affected by other disorders, the impairments are added directly together only in the absence of amputation and presence of full motion of each joint involved. Otherwise, they are combined.\n\nAll other upper extremity impairment ratings are combined.\n\nIt should be noted that, in terms of upper extremity impairment, the functional unit values for the shoulder (60%), elbow (70%), wrist (60%), and digital joints differ from those assigned for amputation at similar levels (Tables 16-4 and 16-18 and Section 16.4).\n\n\n16.2 b Amputation Impairment: Levels Proximal to Digits\nThe amputation impairment ratings increase with progressively shorter stumps and reach 70% of the whole person for a scapulothoracic (forequarter) amputation, as illustrated in Figure 16-2 and noted in Table 16-4. Amputations through the humerus at or proximal to the deltoid tubercle level (approximately the axillary fold) correspond to 100% loss of the limb, or 60% impairment of the whole person.\nAmputations occurring between a level just distal to the deltoid tubercle and the bicipital tuberosity\n\n\n16.2  Amputations\n\n16.2 a General Principles\nImportant factors to consider in evaluating amputations include not only the level of occurrence but also the presence of associated problems relating to the condition of the residual stump (Section 16.2d), to regional or central pain syndromes, and to restriction or loss of motion of existing proximal joints (Section 16.4).",

The hand is further separated into digits and their parts. From distally to proximally, each anatomic unit is given a relative value to the next larger unit and, eventually, the whole person. By multiplying the appropriate percent, impairment of each unit can be converted sequentially to hand, upper extremity, and whole person impairment as indicated in Tables 16-1, 16-2, 16-3, and 16-4 and\nFigures 16-2 and 16-3.\n\nRedrawn with permission from Swanson AB.

Amputations occurring between a level just distal to the bicipital tuberosity and the metacarpophalangeal joints of all digits are estimated to represent 94% to 90% impairment of the upper extremity (56% to 54% of the whole person) according to the functional possibilities afforded by either prosthetic or surgical options (eg, Krukenberg procedure), or simply by the actual length of the residual stump. The evaluator must use clinical judgment to select the appropriate values.\n\n\n16.2 c Amputation Impairment: Digital Levels\nPrinciples\nAmputation of all digits (fingers and thumb) through the metacarpophalangeal joints removes the most essential parts of the hand and is considered 100% impairment of the hand, or 90% impairment of the\n\nupper extremity. Since loss of the entire upper extremity represents 60% impairment of the whole person, this corresponds to 90% ? 60%, or 54% impairment of the whole person (Figures 16-2 and 16-3 and Tables 16-1 through 16-4).\n\nAmputation through each joint level of a digit is given a relative value of loss to the entire digit as follows: digit metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint, 100%; thumb interphalangeal (IP) joint, 50%; finger proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, 80%; and finger distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, 45% (Figures 16-3, 16-4, and 16-5; Table 16-4). Digit impairment values for amputation at various levels are shown in Figures 16-4 (thumb) and 16-5 (fingers). Joints should be named rather than numbered.\n\nAmputations of the thumb at levels proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint are considered to provide a greater severity of impairment than amputation at the MP joint level. Amputation through the thumb MP joint represents a 36% impairment of the upper extremity. Amputation through the distal third of the first metacarpal receives 37% impairment of the upper extremity, and amputation at or near the first carpometacarpal joint is given 38% impairment of the upper extremity (Table 16-4).",

To avoid confusion, digits are named rather than numbered.\n\nBy multiplying the appropriate percentages, the impairment rating for each digit, or portion thereof, is converted to an impairment rating of the larger units, the hand, the upper extremity, and, finally, the whole person (Tables 16-1 through 16-4).\nMP\n\nThumb amputation levels\n\nPIP\n\nFinger amputation levels\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 %\n\nRedrawn with permission from Swanson AB.

Surg Clin North Am. 1964;44:925-940.\n\na Clinical Evaluation\nEvaluation of sensory function in the hand considers all modalities of sensibility, including perception of pain, warmth, cold, and touch-pressure, as well as vibration.\n\nThe grading system introduced by the Nerve Injuries Committee of the British Medical Research Council in 1954 describes six levels of sensory recovery after nerve injury. These levels are still used today to describe sensory changes:\n\nS0\nAbsent sensibility\nS1\nRecovery of deep cutaneous pain and pressure sensibility (protective sensibility absent)\nS2\nReturn of some degree of superficial cutaneous pain and tactile sensibility, and temperature appreciation (protective sensibility decreased)\nS3\nReturn of superficial cutaneous pain and tactile sensibility (light touch diminished)\nS3+ Some recovery of two-point discrimination S4\nComplete sensory recovery\n\nGenerally, if an individual has some light touch recognition, the sensory submodalities are assumed to be present.\n\nAll clinical tests used to examine the degree of functional loss of sensibility are related to cutaneous touch-pressure sensation. At present, the two-point test for fine discrimination sensibility is most widely used, followed by the monofilament touch-pressure threshold test. The pinprick test can be useful to determine whether pain protective sensation is intact and to identify discrepancies between dermatomal findings and reported symptoms. More accurate assessment is obtained by using the sharp and dull sides of the pin at random. Vibration testing has yet to be associated with functional levels of sensibility.\n\nThe Ninhydrin sweat test and wrinkle test may be useful in documenting interruption of digital nerves, especially where questions exist concerning consistency between reported symptoms and neurologic findings. However, these tests have limitations in evaluating a recovering or compressed nerve, because they do not correlate with the presence or absence of sensibility in a regenerating nerve. The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament pressure aesthesiometer measures light-touch and deep-pressure thresholds with sufficient accuracy to quantify returning sensibility levels long before two-point discrimination is measurable. The moving two-point discrimination test may be useful in evaluating recovering nerve function because response to this stimulus returns before response to a static two-point stimulus. Functional isolation of the finger, as noted in the blindfolded picking-up test, can help determine the presence or absence of any useful sensibility in the digit.",
  "Section 171 - 3011 chars": "The patterns of nerve loss and recovery seen in neuropathy or neuritis from disease or nerve compression are different from those following nerve lacerations. Within the limits of current instruments, two-point discrimination tests have been normal, whereas both the Semmes-Weinstein pressure aesthesiometer and nerve conduction studies have been abnormal in both clinical and induced neuropathies. Two-point discrimination has its widest application for individuals who have sustained nerve lacerations, in whom presence of two-point discrimination usually indicates significant return of function.\n\nThe classic Weber static two-point discrimination test is most valuable. Moberg originally described the use of a paper clip opened and bent into a caliper. The Disk-Criminator, DeMayo 2-Point Discrimination Device, and Boley Gauge are some of the currently available testing instruments. Testing is started distally and proceeds proximally. The distance between the tips of the instrument is set first at 5 mm. As the individual being tested closes his or her eyes, the tips of the testing device are applied lightly to the sides of the pulp of the distal segment of the digit in a random sequence, in a longitudinal orientation. Because it is light-touch discrimination that is being tested, the pressure applied should be very light and must not produce a point of blanching or skin indentation. The interval between applications should be no less than 3 to 5 seconds. A series of touches with one or two\n\npoints is made, and the individual immediately indicates whether one or two points are felt. Two out of three responses must be accurate for scoring. The distance between the ends is progressively increased until the required accurate responses are elicited, at which time the distance is recorded.\n\nSensibility assessment is one of the most challenging tasks in impairment evaluation. The subjective nature of sensibility testing can relate to a number of variables involving the testing environment, the individual being tested, the test instruments and methods of administration, and the examiner. Tests should be administered in a quiet environment void of extraneous noises that distract the individual and the tester. Examinee-related variables can include attitude, concentration, anxiety, and the like. Abnormal skin texture, such as calluses, also influences the test results. Instrument-related variables include manufacturing quality control, readjustment of calibration as needed over time, and the weight of various instruments.\nImportant method-related variables include rate and duration of stimulus application, the amount of pressure exerted on the skin, and whether the stimulus is moving or constant. Instruments designed to control the force and velocity of two-point or monofilament application and of other stimuli are not yet available. The examiner\u2019s experience, attention to detail, and adherence to methods of administration can minimize the effects of the above variables.",
  "Section 172 - 3223 chars": "16.3 b Digital Nerve Sensory Impairment Evaluation: Principles\nOnly unequivocal and permanent sensory deficits are given permanent impairment ratings. Sensory impairment is rated according to the sensory quality and the distribution of the sensory loss.\n\nThe sensory quality is based on the results of the\ntwo-point discrimination test carried out over the distal palmar area of the digit, or on the most distal part of the stump in the presence of a partial amputation. Sensibility defects on the dorsal surfaces of the digits are not considered impairing. The sensory quality impairment is classified according to Table 16-5.\nIn total sensory losses (>15 mm), the response to touch, pinprick, pressure, and vibratory stimuli is absent. In partial sensory losses (7-15 mm), there is poor localization and abnormal response to the sensory stimuli.\n\nTotal transverse sensory loss impairments correspond to 50% of amputation values.\n\nThe sensory quality impairment ratings derived from Table 16-5 are to be used only for impairment due to lesions of digital nerves.

Evaluation of impairment of function in the hand. Surg Clin North Am. 1964;44:925-940.\n\nIn assessing motion, the examiner should first observe what an individual can and cannot do by asking him or her to move each joint of the extremity, from the shoulder down, through its full range of motion. Both extremities should be compared. Individual joints are then evaluated separately. Similarly, movements of the digits are first evaluated as a unit by having the individual make a complete fist and then extend the digits fully over several repetitions. In determining the range of motion of individual joints, the examiner must evaluate both the active and the passive motion. Active or voluntary motion is that performed by the active con-\ntraction of the governing muscles and is evaluated first. When a person has full active joint excursion, passive motion values need not to be taken because a joint that has full active excursion will have a full passive range as well. However, if the active arc of motion is incomplete, assisted active and/or passive motion measurements are necessary to evaluate the joint motion.",
  "Section 174 - 3038 chars": "Passive motion is that produced by an external force to determine the freedom and range of motion existing at a joint when all muscles are relaxed. An example,\nis Bunnell\u2019s test for intrinsic tightness in the hand. Assisted active motion is the result of active muscle contraction and an external force applied to the joint; it allows for stabilization of a segment to improve the mechanical advantage of the muscles that move the joint being measured. In both cases, approximately 0.5 kg of force is applied while a segment of the joint is stabilized. Measurements of active motion take precedence in the Guides. The actual measured goniometer readings or linear measurements are recorded.\n\nMany different factors can limit the normal range of motion of the joints of the upper extremities.\nLimitation of active motion can be due to failure of the nerve, muscle, or tendon to execute the motion. Limitation of passive motion can be from involvement of the joint itself, a fixed contracture, or the antagonistic muscle or tendon that holds back the motion because it is adherent or too short. Sound clinical knowledge and measurement techniques are necessary for appropriate impairment evaluation and rating.\n\nDigital joints are measured with the wrist held in neutral position and the forearm pronated. To measure the ROM of individual joints, the proximal joint(s) are stabilized in extension, and only the joint being measured is flexed. Note that if all three joints are flexed simultaneously, as in making a fist, active flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint will be decreased. In some cases of decreased finger motion due to limited excursion of the activating musculotendinous unit or blockage of motion by the antagonistic musculotendinous unit, the measurement of individual joints, as described earlier, can be normal or near normal. In these situations, the total active range of motion (TAM) of the digit is measured.\nFlexion of each joint is measured while all three joints are held in a position of maximum active flexion, or the finger is flexed as a whole unit; similarly, extension of each joint is measured while all three joints are held in maximum extension. The methods used to derive motion impairment of a digit using individual joint measurements and the total active range of motion of a digit are different, as explained on p. 465, Combining Abnormal Motion at More Than One Finger Joint. The joint measurement technique that best reflects the existing impairment is selected.\n\n\n16.4 b Principle for Motion Impairment Calculation: A = E + F\nThe arc of motion is the total number of degrees of excursion measured between the two extreme angles of a plane of motion of a joint, for example, from maximum extension to maximum flexion. When there is complete loss of joint motion, or ankylosis, the total number of degrees of lost motion (A) equals the sum of lost extension degrees (E) and lost flexion degrees (F), or A = E + F. A always equals the total number of degrees of the normal arc of motion.",
  "Section 175 - 3525 chars": "The symbol V represents the measured angle. The measured angle of extension is represented by Vext, and the measured angle of flexion is represented by Vflex. Assuming that a joint, which normally has a range of motion of 0\u00b0 extension to 90\u00b0 flexion, has a measured Vext at 0\u00b0 and Vflex at 90\u00b0, then there is no loss of motion.\n\nWhen the joint flexion is decreased, F (lost flexion degrees) equals the theoretically largest Vflex minus the measured Vflex. For example, if a joint that would normally flex to 90\u00b0 has a measured Vflex at 60\u00b0:\nF = 90\u00b0 \u2013 60\u00b0 = 30\u00b0 flexion loss.\n\nWhen joint extension is decreased, E (lost extension degrees) equals the measured Vext minus the theoretically smallest Vext. For example, if a joint that would normally extend to 0\u00b0 has an extension lag measured at Vext 20\u00b0: E = 20\u00b0 \u2013 0\u00b0 = 20\u00b0 extension loss.\n\nWith decreasing flexion, Vflex decreases, and with increasing extension loss, Vext increases; as motion is lost, these values will finally meet at the same point on the arc of motion, or Vflex will equal Vext. When this occurs, there is ankylosis, or total loss of the potential arc of motion degrees (A). For example,\nif a joint that would normally extend to 0\u00b0 and flex to 90\u00b0 is ankylosed at 40\u00b0: Vext = Vflex = 40\u00b0; E = 40\u00b0 \u2013 0\u00b0 = 40\u00b0; F = 90\u00b0 \u2013 40\u00b0 = 50\u00b0;\nA = 40\u00b0 (E) + 50\u00b0 (F), or 90\u00b0; and there is total loss of the potential full arc of motion.\n\nImpairment of finger motion may be due to loss of extension (E) with or without loss of flexion (F) or to ankylosis (A). The restricted motion impairment percents are called IE%, IF%, and IA%, respectively, and are functions of the angle (V) measured at examination.\n\nIE% = 0% when Vext reaches its smallest theoretical value.\nIF% = 0% when Vflex reaches its largest theoretical value.\nIA% = IE% + IF% when Vext= Vflex.\n\nThe formula A% = E% + F% can also be written\nE% = A% \u2013 F%; therefore, impairment values for lack of extension (IE%) can be derived for any measured extension angle on the basis that IE% = IA% \u2013 IF%.\nThe derivation of both IE% and IF% allows estimation of impairment percentages relating not only to the number of degrees of lost motion but, most important, to the location of the loss on the arc of motion.\n\nMotion impairment curves based on the formula A% = E% + F% were derived on a 100% scale for each motion unit of each upper extremity joint, tak-\ning into consideration the functional position of each joint as recommended in the literature for fusion (eg, Figure 16-11). The value of A% reaches its maximum, or 100%, at the two extreme positions of the arc of motion and drops to its lowest percent when the angle of ankylosis corresponds to the position of function of the joint. The motion impairment curves plotted on a 100% motion unit scale were converted to pie charts of regional motion impairment (thumb, finger, upper extremity) by applying the relative regional value of each respective motion unit as a conversion factor (eg, Figure 16-12).\n\nFor example, wrist functional unit = 60% of upper extremity function. Flexion/extension unit = 70% of wrist function unit, or 70% ? 60% = 42% of upper extremity function. Radial/ulnar deviation unit = 30% of wrist functional unit, or 30% ? 60% = 18% of upper extremity function. The flexion/extension motion unit impairment curve (Figure 16-27) was multiplied by 42% to derive the pie chart of upper extremity impairment (Figure 16-28) resulting from restricted wrist flexion/extension. The radial/ulnar deviation motion unit impairment curve (Figure",
  "Section 176 - 3189 chars": "16-30) was multiplied by 18% to obtain the pie chart of upper extremity impairment (Figure 16-31) resulting from restricted wrist lateral deviation.\n\n\n16.4 c Method for Motion Impairment Calculation\nThe motion impairment pie charts are used for motion impairment calculation of a specific joint. Because the same relative value scale is applied to each motion unit and to its components, the impairment values derived for each are added directly together to obtain the total motion impairment of a specific joint. The total impairment value of a motion unit is obtained by adding the impairment values contributed by its two component movements (eg, impairment of flexion/extension motion unit = IF% + IE%). Similarly, when a joint has more than one unit of motion (eg, elbow flexion/extension and pronation/supination), its total motion impairment is obtained by adding the impairment values contributed by each unit of motion. When a joint that has a single unit of motion (eg, MP joint) is ankylosed, IA% represents its motion impairment. When a joint that has more than one unit of motion (eg, the elbow) is ankylosed, the ankylosis impairments (IA%) derived for each motion unit are added to obtain its total motion impairment.\n\n\n1.

  "Section 178 - 3361 chars": "Adding Two or More Abnormal Thumb Motions\n\n1. Measure and record the thumb impairments of flexion and extension at the IP and MP joints (Figures 16-12 and 16-15), radial abduction and adduction (Table 16-8a), adduction (Table 16-8b), and opposition (Table 16-9) as described above.\n\n2. Add the impairment values contributed by each motion unit to determine the total thumb impairment due to abnormal motion.\n\nBecause the relative value of each unit of motion to the entire thumb ray was taken into consideration in the thumb impairment charts and tables, the thumb impairments resulting from abnormal motion are added directly together. If each thumb unit of motion were impaired to its maximum value, the total thumb motion impairment would add to 100%. Note that when more than one finger joint is involved, the impairment values are combined because the relative value of each finger joint (DIP, PIP, MP) was not assigned on a 100% finger unit scale.\n\n16.4e Finger Motion Impairment\nThe fingers have three functional units of motion, each having the same relative functional value as that found in amputation impairment: DIP, 45%; PIP, 80%; and MP, 100% (Table 16-4).\n\nFor each joint, unit-of-motion impairment curves were derived according to the basic formula, A = E + F, and converted to pie charts of finger impairment values by applying the relative value of each functional unit as a conversion factor (Figures 16-21,\n\n16-23, and 16-25).\n\nIn the normal hand, the MP joint can hyperextend usefully to 20\u00b0; a small percentage of extension impairment has been assigned to loss of hyperextension, or IE% = 5% at 0\u00b0 extension (Figure 16-25). The PIP and DIP joints normally extend to 0\u00b0, and IE% equals 0% at this angle; between the angles of 0\u00b0 extension and\n+30\u00b0 hyperextension, impairment values are given for lack of flexion and not for hyperextension.\nConsideration for positions of hyperextension allows one to rate impairment of flexion or ankylosis for angles above the 0\u00b0 neutral position. For example, ankylosis of the PIP joint in 30\u00b0 hyperextension equals 80% finger impairment (Figure 16-23). Note that, for each joint, the ankylosis impairment value is at its lowest for the angle of functional position.\n\n%\n\n42\n\nIA% = Impairment due to ankylosis\nIE% = Impairment due to loss of extension\nIF% = Impairment due to loss of flexion\nV  = Measured angles of motion\n= Position of function\n\nAdapted from Swanson AB, Hagert CG, de Groot Swanson G.

Characteristic deformities and manifestations resulting from peripheral nerve lesions, such as restricted motion, atrophy, and vasomotor, trophic, and reflex changes, have been taken into consideration in the estimated impairment values shown in this section. Therefore, when an impairment results strictly from a peripheral nerve lesion, in the absence of CRPS, the motion impairment values derived from Section 16.4 are not applied to this section to avoid duplication or unwarranted increase in the impairment estimation. For example, the claw hand deformity of MP joint hyperextension and IP joint flexion of the ring and little fingers is a classic manifestation of an ulnar nerve lesion; in absence of CRPS II/causalgia, the impairment value for motor deficit of the ulnar nerve is derived according to this section and applied without assigning additional impairment for loss of motion. However, if restricted motion cannot be attributed strictly to a peripheral nerve lesion, such as would be the case in CRPS I/RSD, the motion impairment values are evaluated separately according to Section",

When both sensory and motor functions are involved, the impairment values derived for each are combined (Combined Values Chart, p. 604). The steps of the impairment determination method are detailed below.\n\nThe origins and functions of the peripheral nerves that serve the upper extremities are summarized in Table 16-12. The motor innervation of the upper extremity is shown in Figure 16-47. The cutaneous innervation and related nerves are shown in Figure 16-48, the dermatomes of the upper extremities in Figure 16-49, and a schematic diagram of the brachial plexus in Figure 16-50.\n\nImpairment Determination Method\nUse the following method to evaluate the impairment resulting from each peripheral nerve structure:\n\n\n1. If sensory deficits or pain is present, localize the distribution and relate it to the nerve structure involved (Table 16-12 and Figures 16-48, 16-49,\nand 16-50).\n\n2. If motor deficits or loss of power is present, identify the key muscles involved and relate the motor deficit to the nerve structure(s) involved (Table 16-12 and Figures 16-47 and 16-50).\n\n3. Grade the severity of sensory deficits or pain according to Table 16-10a and/or that of the motor deficits according to Table 16-11a.\n\n4. Find the values for maximum impairment of the upper extremity due to sensory and/or motor deficits of the nerve structure involved: individual spinal nerve (Table 16-13), brachial plexus (Table 16-14), and major peripheral nerves (Table 16-15).\n\n5. For each nerve structure involved, multiply the grade of severity of the sensory and/or motor deficits (see step 3 above) by the appropriate maximum upper extremity impairment value (see step 4 above) to determine the upper extremity impairment percent for each function.\n\n6.\nFor a structure with mixed motor and sensory fibers, determine the upper extremity impairment for each function (steps 1 through 5), then combine the sensory and motor impairment percents (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment value.\n\n7. When more than one nerve structure is involved, combine their respective upper extremity impairment values (steps 1 through 5) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment resulting from peripheral nerve disorders (Combined Values Chart).\n\n8. When multiple impairments of the extremity are present because of amputation, loss of motion that is not strictly attributed to a peripheral nerve lesion, or peripheral vascular disorders, combine the peripheral nerve upper extremity impairment value with the other upper extremity impairment values (Combined Values Chart) to obtain the total upper extremity impairment.",

Consult page 435 for further comments on bilateral upper extremity involvement.\n\nGrading Sensory Deficits or Pain\nA wide range of abnormal sensations may be associated with peripheral nerve lesions, including diminished sensation (anesthesia or hypesthesia), abnormal sensation (dysesthesia or paresthesia), and increased sensation (hyperesthesia). Another possible manifestation is pain of various types, including pain resulting from nonnoxious stimulus (allodynia), overreactive pain (hyperpathia), a state of dysesthetic pain (deafferentation), and, most significantly, the sustained, burning pain present in CRPS I (RSD)\nand CRPS II (causalgia). Cold intolerance may also be present.\n\nSensory deficits or pain associated with peripheral nerve disorders are evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) How does the sensory deficit or pain interfere with the individual\u2019s performance of daily activities?

(3) To what extent is the description of the sensory deficit or pain consistent with characteristics of peripheral nerve disorders? (4) To what extent does the sensory deficit or pain correspond to other disturbances (motor, trophic, vasomotor, etc) of the involved nerve structure?\n\nThe methods for clinical assessment of sensibility are detailed in Section 16.3. In individuals with nerve lacerations, the presence of two-point discrimination usually indicates significant return of function. However, in conditions such as radiculitis, causalgia, and entrapment or compression neuropathy, normal two-point discrimination does not exclude the presence of abnormal light-touch/deeppressure thresholds and abnormal conduction studies. Conversely, the presence of a normal light-touch threshold does not necessarily indicate that two-point discrimination is normal in these cases. The use of the Semmes-Weinstein touch-pressure threshold monofilament test may be a helpful adjunct to the two-point discrimination test to help assess changes in light-touch sensibility.\n\nUpper extremity impairments due to sensory deficits or pain resulting from peripheral nerve disorders are determined according to the grade of severity in diminution or loss of function and the relative maximum upper extremity impairment value of the nerve structure involved, as shown in the classification\n(a) and procedural (b) steps described in Table 16-10 and the impairment determination method detailed in Section 16.5b. Table 16-10 provides a classification for determining impairment of the upper extremity due to a sensory deficit or pain resulting from a nerve disorder. This table is to be used for pain that is due to nerve injury or disease that has been documented with objective physical findings or electrodiagnostic abnormalities. It is not to be used for pain in the distribution of a nerve that has not been injured except in diagnosed cases of complex regional pain syndromes. The examiner must use clinical judgment to estimate the appropriate percentage of sensory deficits or pain within the range of values shown for each severity grade. The maximum value for each grade is not applied automatically.",

Evaluation of permanent impairment in the hand and upper extremity. In: Doege TC, ed. Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Imapirment. Fourth ed. Chicago, Ill: American Medical Assocation; 1993.\n\nEntrapment neuropathy is a nerve compression\u2013type lesion that implies disproportion between the volume of the peripheral nerve and the space through which it passes. The underlying causes may be intrinsic or extrinsic, in that the nerve itself or the other contents of the passage may be enlarged or the passage space may be narrowed. The differential diagnosis of entrapment neuropathy is extensive. The local causes can relate to specific anatomic variations in the configuration of bones or soft tissue resulting from chronic irritation or an inflammatory process such as tenosynovitis; mechanical causes such as blunt trauma, fractures, or scarring; or congenital anomalies such as aberrant muscles, arteries, or a cervical rib in the thoracic outlet region. Neoplastic conditions, such as myeloma or neurofibromatosis, or space-occupying lesions, such as ganglion, lipoma, or fibroma, must be ruled out. Predisposing or associated conditions can include diabetes, arthritis, alcoholism, renal disease, hormonal changes, malnutrition, or obesity.\n\n\u2020 See Table 16-11a to grade motor deficits.\n\nFourth ed. Chicago, Ill: American Medical Association; 1993.\n\nPeripheral nerves can become compressed at any level from the hand to the thoracocervical region. One nerve can be trapped simultaneously at two levels, or more than one nerve can be trapped. Certain anatomic constraints make particular nerves at specific sites more vulnerable, leading to well-defined patterns or syndromes. Generally, each nerve lesion can be described clinically as a high or a low lesion, that is, a high or a low median, radial, or ulnar lesion. The most frequently encountered entrapment is of the median nerve at the wrist, leading to the carpal tunnel syndrome, followed by the ulnar nerve at the elbow. The recurrent motor branch of the median nerve can be involved singly or in combination with the median nerve at the wrist. Knowledge",
  "Section 189 - 3333 chars": "of normal and variant anatomy, both gross and microscopic, is essential for accurate diagnosis and precise localization of the lesion.\n\nDiagnosis of Entrapment/Compression Neuropathy\nThe diagnosis of entrapment/compression neuropathy is based on (1) the history and symptoms;\n(2) objective clinical signs and findings on detailed examination; and (3) documentation by electroneuromyographic studies. Standard roentgenograms and more involved imaging studies are also useful.\n\nThe history should include a listing of occupation(s), activities of daily living, factors that alleviate or aggravate the symptoms, medical conditions, and past surgical procedures or trauma. The entrapment of a major peripheral nerve or one of its branches is reflected by a disturbance of a specific motor, sensory, or autonomic function. Functionally, the symptoms may vary from slight paresthesia, motor weakness, or both to complete sensibility loss, muscle paralysis, or both. The severity of the nerve damage and symptoms depends on the duration, magnitude, and type of compression as well as on the microanatomy of the nerve involved.\n\nThe physical examination evaluates sensibility alterations, muscle power, range of motion, grip strength, and tendon reflexes. Increased pressure over an entrapped nerve, or its irritation by tapping or stretching, is reflected by paresthesia (sensation of electrical shock) in its autonomous zone and possibly by limitation of motion because of pain. Individuals with compression neuropathies show different patterns of loss and recovery than individuals with lacerations. They may have normal two-point discrimination but abnormal light-touch/deep-pressure recognition. SemmesWeinstein monofilament testing can be indicated in these cases. Provocative tests are helpful to induce clinical symptoms; these include, for example, the tourniquet, Phalen\u2019s or reverse Phalen\u2019s, elbow flexion, and Adson\u2019s tests. Nerve percussion tests are performed distal to proximal and then directly over the area of a sensitive cutaneous or major mixed nerve.\nTesting of Tinel\u2019s sign should be reserved for regenerating nerves to document the progress and speed of axon regeneration after repair of a lacerated nerve or decompression of a severely compressed nerve.\n\nThe electroneurodiagnostic examination includes electromyographic (needle and cutaneous) examinations, which evaluate only motor unit potentials, and motor and sensory nerve conduction studies. These procedures assess only the largest, most heavily myelinated axons; the lightly myelinated and unmyelinated axons that transmit pain are not directly evaluated. A fundamental point is that, regardless of the cause of nerve damage, the electrodiagnostic studies essentially can detect only two types of pathophysiology of the peripheral nerve system fibers: (1) axon loss (axonotmetic lesion), which is manifested as conduction failure, and (2) focal demyelination (neuropraxic lesion), which can cause either conduction slowing or conduction block, depending on the severity of the process. The severity of conduction slowing has no correlation with the severity of clinical symptoms, such as weakness or static large-fiber sensory loss. If these are present, substantial amounts of either conduction block, axon loss, or a combination of both must be present.",
  "Section 190 - 3522 chars": "Impairment Rating of Entrapment/Compression Neuropathies Only individuals with an objectively verifiable diag-\nnosis should qualify for a permanent impairment rating. The diagnosis is made not only on believable symptoms but, more important, on the presence of positive clinical findings and loss of function. The diagnosis should be documented by electromyography as well as sensory and motor nerve conduction studies. However, it is critical to understand that there is no correlation between the severity of conduction delay on nerve conduction velocity testing and the severity of either symptoms or, more important, impairment rating. The surgical findings of evidence of nerve compression and reactive hyperemia upon nerve release help confirm the diagnosis.\n\nPostoperatively, a sufficient amount of time for optimal physiologic recovery and rehabilitation should elapse before an individual qualifies for permanent impairment rating should there be residual symptoms or clinical findings. Factors affecting nerve recovery in compression lesions include nerve fiber pathology, level of injury, duration of injury, and status of the end organs. Age is not a prognostic factor. Sensory function usually returns before motor function. High axonotmetic lesions may take 1 to 2 years for maximal recovery, whereas even lesions at the wrist may take 6 to 9 months for maximal recovery of nerve function. During the recovery time, individuals can experience some of the preoperative symptoms. An advancing Tinel\u2019s sign can be monitored and is a good prognostic sign.\n\nThe sensory deficits or pain, and/or the motor deficits and loss of power, are evaluated according to the impairment determination method described in Section 16.5b. Sensory impairments strictly due to lesions of digital nerves are evaluated according to Section 16.3. In compression neuropathies, additional impairment values are not given for decreased grip strength. In the absence of CRPS, additional impairment values are not given for decreased motion. In the presence of associated CRPS II (causalgia), the compression neuropathy is evaluated according to the principles of CRPS II described in Section 16.5e.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome\nThe carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common of nerve compression lesions and involves the median nerve at the volar aspect of the wrist. There are many presentations of CTS. Pain and paresthesias in the median nerve distribution of the hand are the usual symptoms. Pain may radiate proximally. Nocturnal paresthesias, relieved by shaking the hand, are frequently reported and can be the only symptom in the earliest stages of nerve pathology. True sensory disturbances and muscle atrophy represent later stages, when axonotmesis with axonal degeneration is also present. The symptoms, signs, and findings may include sensory or autonomic disturbances of the radial 31/2 digits, weakness or atrophy of the thenar muscles, a positive percussion sign at the wrist, presence of Phalen\u2019s sign, and motor and sensory electroneuromyographic abnormalities. Not all symptoms are necessarily present in any one case. In isolated involvement of the recurrent branch of the median nerve, there is weakness of thumb abduction and thenar atrophy without any sensory disturbance in the hand. Sensitivity to cold may be a major presenting symptom of CTS. Certain cases may be associated with reflex dystrophy (CRPS I). It has also been reported that 5% of individuals with CTS may have normal electrophysiologic studies.",
  "Section 191 - 3470 chars": "If, after an optimal recovery time following surgical decompression, an individual continues to complain of pain, paresthesias, and/or difficulties in performing certain activities, three possible scenarios can be present:\n\n\n1. Positive clinical findings of median nerve dysfunction and electrical conduction delay(s): the impairment due to residual CTS is rated according to the sensory and/or motor deficits as described earlier.\n\n2. Normal sensibility and opposition strength with abnormal sensory and/or motor latencies or abnormal EMG testing of the thenar muscles: a residual CTS is still present, and an impairment rating not to exceed 5% of the upper extremity may be justified.\n\n3. Normal sensibility (two-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing), opposition strength, and nerve conduction studies: there is no objective basis for an impairment rating.\n\n\n16.5e Complex Regional Pain Syndromes (CRPS), Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (CRPS I), and Causalgia (CRPS II)\nThe hallmark of these syndromes is a characteristic burning pain that is present without stimulation or movement, that occurs beyond the territory of a single peripheral nerve, and that is disproportionate to the inciting event. The pain is associated with specific clinical findings, including signs of vasomotor and sudomotor dysfunction and, later, trophic changes of all tissues from skin to bone.\n\nSympathetic nervous system dysfunction was thought to be involved in the generation of the symptoms and signs; hence, the term reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Causalgia was considered similar to RSD except, unlike RSD, it followed a lesion of a peripheral nerve, either of a major mixed nerve in the proximal extremity (major causalgia) or of a purely sensory branch more distally (minor causalgia). A recent reconsideration of these syndromes has generated new terminology and ideas concerning the underlying pathophysiology. The International Association for the Study of Pain has proposed the term complex regional pain syndromes, which has replaced the term RSD with CRPS I and causalgia with CRPS II. The most important difference from earlier opinions is that sympathetic dysfunction is not assumed to be the underlying basis for the symptoms and signs of CRPS. It is felt that sympathetically maintained pain is not an essential component of CRPS, as it may be present in a variety of painful conditions, including or independent of CRPS. Contrary to previous suggestions, regional sympathetic blockade has no role in the diagnosis of CRPS.\n\nSince a subjective complaint of pain is the hallmark of these conditions, and many of the associated physical signs and radiologic findings can be the result of disuse, the differential diagnosis is extensive; it includes somatoform pain disorder, somatoform conversion disorder, factitious disorder, and malingering. Consequently, the approach to the diagnosis of these syndromes should be conservative and based on objective findings. The criteria listed in Table 16-16 predicate a diagnosis of CRPS upon a preponderance of objective findings that can be identified during a standard physical examination and demonstrated by radiologic techniques. At least eight of these findings must be present concurrently for a diagnosis of CRPS. Signs are objective evidence of disease perceptible to the examiner, as opposed to symptoms, which are subjective sensations of the individual.",

Physical signs of vascular damage must be present and are the primary determinants in placing the examinee into one of these categories. Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon consists of localized blanching of one or more fingers, followed by a period of cyanosis, followed by erythema. Pain on exposure to cold or generalized paleness of the fingers on exposure to cold does not in itself indicate Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. When amputation because of peripheral vascular disease is involved, the impairment resulting from amputation should be evaluated according to Section\n\n16.2 and combined with the appropriate value in Table 16-17 by means of the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\nIt is important to differentiate symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon on the basis of obstructive physiology from those occurring because of vasoreactivity. Individuals with obstructive physiology will often experience symptoms more frequently and with a greater degree of severity. Establish the presence of obstructive physiology by objective testing. Arterial pressure ratios between the affected digits and the brachial pressure (finger/brachial index) are easily performed. A ratio of < 0.8 suggests obstructive physiology, even if Raynaud\u2019s symptoms are not present. Obstructive physiology can also be established by the use of cutaneous laser Doppler flowmetry. This technique is established and can reliably assess microcirculation performance and real-time changes in skin blood flow.\n\nImpairment of 0% to 9% is indicated by documented Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon with obstructive physiology (as documented by finger-brachial indices of less than 0.8 or low digital temperatures with decreased laser Doppler signals that do not normalize with warming of affected digits) that completely responds to lifestyle changes and/or medical therapy.\n\nImpairment of 10% to 39% is indicated by symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon with obstructive physiology (as documented by finger-brachial indices of less than 0.8 or low digital temperatures with decreased laser Doppler signals that do not normalize with warming of affected digits) that incompletely responds to lifestyle changes and medical therapy.\n\nThe hand impairment value of each digit is the same throughout this entire chapter. If more than one\njoint of a specific digit is affected by impairments due to \u201cother disorders\u201d listed in this section, the applicable joint impairment ratings are added only when the joints involved have a full range of motion.

The criteria described in this section should be used only when the other criteria have not adequately encompassed the extent of the impairments. Some of the conditions described in this section can be concurrent with each other and with decreased motion because they share overlapping pathomechanics. The evaluator must have good understanding of pathomechanics of deformities and apply proper judgment to avoid duplication of impairment ratings.\n\n\n16.7a Bone and Joint Deformities\nIf the same unit presents several findings, the following rules must be followed to avoid duplication of impairments. In the digits, wrist, and elbow, manifestations of joint translocation can include lateral deviation, rotational deformity (digit), and/or subluxation or dislocation in any combination. The impairment values due to these findings cannot be combined, and only the finding with the highest impairment value is rated. Limited motion impairment is rated according to Section 16.4 and can be appropriately combined with impairments due to \u201cother disorders\u201d listed in this section, except with those due to joint swelling from synovial hypertrophy, persistent joint subluxation or dislocation, and musculotendinous disorders (Section 16.7c). Joint instability impairment values can be combined with other appropriate impairment values, including decreased motion, but not with arthroplasty. Joint swelling due to synovial hypertrophy is rated only when no other findings are present. Joint crepitation is not rated separately because other findings, such as those listed above, are more reliable indicators of the severity of the same arthritic process.\n\nModified from Swanson AB, Mays JD, Yamauchi Y.

If synovial hypertrophy is the only finding, the joint impairment is rated according to Table 1619 and multiplied by the relative maximum value of the joint involved (Table 16-18). It cannot be combined with impairment due to decreased joint motion or other findings.\n\nDigit Lateral Deviation\nThe deviation from longitudinal alignment of each of the digital joints is measured in degrees during maximum active extension.

Pain and decreased strength are not rated separately.\n\nThe scapholunate and radiolunate angles are measured on a lateral radiograph taken with the fist forcefully clenched (stressed view) and the wrist in neutral flexion/extension and lateral deviation. Lines are drawn on the film parallel to the long axis of the radius, through the long axis of the scaphoid (palmar surface), and a line representing the long axis of the lunate (a line perpendicular to the line connecting the two distal poles [Figure 16-51]). The angles between these lines are measured. The normal radiolunate relationship should be less than 10\u00b0 of either volar or dorsal lunate angulation. The scapholunate angle ranges from 30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 (average of 47\u00b0). The triquetrolunate stepoff is measured on the neutral posteroanterior (PA) view and represents proximal or ulnar translation of the triquetrum. The scapholunate gap is best profiled on a neutral PA view with the ulnar aspect of the hand elevated 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 or on a neutral anteroposterior (AP) view.\n\nUlnar translation may occur secondary to injury or arthritis. It is measured on the neutral PA view with the fist forcefully clenched. Normally, greater than 50% of the lunate overlies the ulnar border of the distal radius. As ulnar translation becomes more severe, progressively less of the lunate overlies the radius. The grades of severity of upper extremity impairment are classified as mild (8%), wherein less than 50% of the lunate overlies the distal radius ulnar\n\nborder; moderate (16%), wherein less than 25% of the lunate overlies the distal radius ulnar border; and severe (24%), wherein the lunate is displaced ulnarly off the radius (Table 16-25).\n\nThe loading posterior/anterior drawer test is performed with the individual supine and the shoulder in neutral rotation, 60\u00b0 abduction, and 30\u00b0 flexion. One hand stabilizes the extremity in neutral rotation, and the other applies a posteriorly directed force to subluxate the shoulder posteriorly. The position of the examiner\u2019s hands is reversed to reproduce the maneuver applying an anteriorly directed force. Note that in a clinical setting, the examiner can usually evaluate the severity of instability without inducing a shoulder dislocation.\n\nThe posterior/anterior glenohumeral translation has been classified as follows:",
  "Section 196 - 3181 chars": "Trace: Small movement of the humeral head.\nClass I: Humeral head rides up the glenoid but not over the rim.\nClass II: Humeral head subluxes over the glenoid rim but reduces spontaneously in position when the axial load is withdrawn.\nClass III: Humeral head frankly dislocates over the glenoid rim and remains dislocated with removal of force.\n\nThe apprehension and relocation tests are best carried out with the individual in a supine position. The anterior apprehension test is performed by applying external rotation as the shoulder is held in 90\u00b0 abduction. If the test is positive, the individual fears that the humeral head will slide out, causing pain.\nMuscular defense against the motion is usually present. However, presence of pain alone is not necessarily diagnostic of instability. The anterior relocation test (Jobe\u2019s) is performed by applying a posteriorly directed force to the proximal humerus while the shoulder is in 90\u00b0 abduction and external rotation with the individual supine. This posterior stabilizing force should reduce the humeral head and relieve any apprehension of anterior instability.\n\nShoulder instability patterns are based on the parameters listed in Table 16-26 and can be classified as occult instability, instability with a subluxating humeral head, and instability with a dislocating humeral head. The shoulder representing 60% of the upper extremity (Table 16-18), the patterns of occult (10%), subluxating (20%), and dislocating (40%) instabilities represent upper extremity impairments of 6%, 12%, and 24%, respectively. This value may be combined only with impairments due to decreased motion (Section 16.4). Pain and decreased muscle strength are not rated separately.\n\nAnalysis: According to Table 16-26, a class II humeral translation (subluxating head) with a history of previous trauma, consistent relationship of symptoms with specific motions, reproducible symptoms on clinical testing, and positive radiographic findings corresponds to 12% upper extremity impairment.\nThe upper extremity impairment due to decreased shoulder motion is found in Section 16.4: IADD% = 0% and IABD% = 2% (Figure 16-43); IIR% = 0%\nand IER% = 0% (Figure 16-46). The upper extremity motion impairment is 2%.\nImpairment Rating: The upper extremity impairments due to shoulder instability (12%) and decreased motion (2%) are combined (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) and equal 14% of the upper extremity, or 8% of the whole person (Table 16-3).\n\nCompiled by EG McFarland, MD, Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nModified from Swanson AB, Mays JD, Yamauchi Y.

Surg Clin North Am. 1968;48:1003-1013.\n\nExtensor Tendon Subluxation at the MP Joint of the Fingers\nThe digit impairment due to extensor tendon subluxation at the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint (Table 1630) is multiplied by the relative hand value of the digit (Table 16-18) to obtain its hand impairment value. It cannot be combined with impairment due to restricted motion at the MP joint or to other related manifestations of the same pathomechanical disturbance.\n\n\n16.7 d Tendinitis\nSeveral syndromes involving the upper extremity are variously attributed to tendinitis, fasciitis, or epicondylitis. The most common of these are the stubborn conditions of the origins of the flexor and extensor muscles of the forearm where they attach to the medial and lateral epicondyles of the humerus. Although these conditions may be persistent for some time, they are not given a permanent impairment rating unless there is some other factor that must be considered.\n\nIf an individual has had tendon rupture or has undergone surgical release of the flexor or extensor origins or medial or lateral epicondylitis, or has had excision of the epicondyle, there may be some permanent weakness of grip as a result of the tendon rupture or the surgery. In this case, impairment can be given on the basis of weakness of grip strength according to Section 16.8b. Although there is no good data on the time required to regain maximum strength after surgery, the data on strength loss after carpal tunnel release suggests that impairment rating according to Section 16.8b should not be determined less than 1 year after surgery.\n\n\n16.8 Strength Evaluation\nBecause strength measurements are functional tests influenced by subjective factors that are difficult to control and the Guides for the most part is based on anatomic impairment, the Guides does not assign a large role to such measurements. Those who have contributed to the Guides believe that further research is needed before loss of grip and pinch strength is given a larger role in impairment evaluation.\n\nStrength measures the power with which musculotendinous units act across a bone-joint lever-arm system to actively generate motion, or passively resist movement against gravity and variable resistance.\nThe effectiveness and magnitude of muscle contraction depends on the integrity of the dynamic and passive elements of a complex lever system, including its muscles and tendons, normal passive motion in the joints across which the muscles act, and the quality of innervation of the muscles. Many subjective or nonmeasurable factors, including fatigue, handedness, time of day, age, nutritional state, pain, and the individual\u2019s cooperation, further influence strength measurements. Voluntary muscle strength testing remains somewhat subjective until a precise way of measuring muscle contraction is generally available. It should also be noted that the correlation of strength with performance of activities of daily living is poor and that increased strength does not necessarily equate with increased function.",
  "Section 198 - 3131 chars": "16.8 a Principles\nIn a rare case, if the examiner believes the individual\u2019s loss of strength represents an impairing factor that has not been considered adequately by other methods in the Guides, the loss of strength may be rated separately. An example of this situation would be loss of strength due to a severe muscle tear that healed leaving a palpable muscle defect. If the examiner judges that loss of strength should be rated separately in an extremity that presents other impairments, the impairment due to loss of strength could be combined with the other impairments, only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes. Otherwise, the impairment ratings based on objective anatomic findings take precedence.\nDecreased strength cannot be rated in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of parts (eg, thumb amputation) that prevent effective application of maximal force in the region being evaluated.\n\nMotor weakness associated with disorders of the peripheral nerve system and various degenerative neuromuscular conditions are evaluated according to guidelines described in Section 16.5 and the Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System. It should be understood that weakness or loss of strength can occur without muscle atrophy.\n\nWhen evaluating strength, the examiner must have good reason to believe the individual has reached maximal medical improvement and that the condition is a \u201cpermanent\u201d one as defined in Chapter 1 and the Glossary. Maximum strength is usually not regained for at least a year after an injury or surgical procedure. Because impairment is evaluated when the individual has reached MMI, strength can only be applied as a measure when a year or more has passed since the time of injury or surgery. This determination is best made with measurements taken over a period of time. Two methods are used to determine loss of strength in the upper extremity. Measurements of grip and pinch strength are used to evaluate power weaknesses relating to the structures in the hand, wrist, or forearm.\nManual muscle testing of major groups is used for testing strength about the elbow and shoulder.\n\n\n16.8b Grip and Pinch Strength\nTests repeated at intervals during an examination are considered to be reliable if there is less than 20% variation in the readings. If there is more than 20% variation in the readings, one may assume the individual is not exerting full effort. The test is usually repeated three times with each hand at different times during the examination, and the values are recorded and later compared.\n\nGrip strength measurements must be performed in a standard manner because altering wrist, forearm, and/or elbow position will change the results. The generally accepted position for measurements is for the individual to be seated with back against the chair and feet flat on the floor. The arm should be relaxed beside the lateral torso, the elbow flexed at 90\u00b0, and the forearm and wrist in neutral position. Grip strength measurements may be taken with a Jamar dynamometer. The second (4 cm) or third",
  "Section 199 - 3514 chars": "(6 cm) position, according to the size of the hand, usually allows the individual to apply maximal force comfortably.\n\nTwo techniques have been reported to help detect individuals who exert less than maximal effort on grip strength testing. Stokes pointed out that the plotting of grip strength measurements from each of the five handle settings of the Jamar dynamometer would produce a bell-shaped curve. Those individuals not exerting maximal effort will produce results yielding a straight line or a flat curve.\n\nAn alternate method is the rapid exchange grip technique. The grip strength first is determined by standard techniques. The individual then is instructed to grip the dynamometer with maximal effort, first with one hand, then quickly with the other hand, for at least five exchanges. Individuals who did not exert maximal effort with the standard technique will record significantly higher strength readings. If they become aware of this, the strength of both hands will drop dramatically.\n\nPinch strength measurements are done with a pinch gauge and may include chuck or three-digit pinch, key or lateral pinch, and tip pinch with separate digits. Key pinch measurements usually are sufficient. Measurements are repeated three times. The three readings each for grip and pinch strength are averaged and compared to those of the opposite extremity, which usually is normal. If both extremities are involved, the strength measurements are compared to the average normal strengths listed in Tables 16-31 through 16-33.\n\nAdapted with permission from Swanson AB, Matev IB, de Groot Swanson.

Fall 1970:145-153.\n\nIf there is evidence that the individual is exerting less than maximal effort, the grip strength measurements are invalid for estimating impairment. It is acknowledged that wide variations exist in strength, even among persons doing the same kind of work. Little evidence exists of a significant difference in grip strength between the dominant and nondominant hand. If the evaluator believes that a significant difference in grip strength was lost in the dominant hand and that it impacts the ability to perform activities of daily living, this should be addressed in the evaluation report (see Section 16.1b).\n\nAn index of loss of strength uses the following formula:\n\nNormal strength \u2013 Limited strength = Strength loss Normal strength\nindex %\n\nImpairments of the upper extremity due to loss of pinch and grip strength are based on the values of the strength loss index shown in Table 16-34.\n\nRate the function that measures the greatest loss of strength. Both measurements are not applied.\n\n\n16.8c Manual Muscle Testing\nManual muscle testing assesses an individual\u2019s ability to move a joint through a full range of motion against gravity, or move it against additional resistance applied by the examiner, and/or hold the joint position against resistance. Manual muscle testing is subject to the individual\u2019s conscious or unconscious control. Individuals whose performance is inhibited by pain or fear of pain may not be good candidates for this testing. Results of strength testing should be reproducible on different occasions or by two or more trained observers.",

The relative functional value of each unit of motion is the same as in Section 16.4, Evaluating Abnormal Motion. The severity of strength deficits is classified and rated on the same principles used for evaluation of the peripheral nerves (Table 16-11).\nThe numeric grades are sometimes also named 5, normal; 4, good; 3, fair; 2, poor; 1, trace; and 0, no muscle contraction. In the absence of peripheral nerve involvement, most weaknesses usually fall in the grade 4 category: \u201ccomplete active range of motion against gravity with some resistance.\u201d Few injuries result in a more profound weakness, such as a grade 3 category: \u201ccomplete active range of motion against gravity only, without resistance.\u201d Muscle strength graded 3 or lower is usually accompanied by other clinical findings such as atrophy.

For evaluation purposes, the lower extremities are divided into six sections: the feet, the hindfeet, the ankles, the legs, the knees, the hips, and the pelvis. In addition to the skeletal framework, assessment of the lower extremities also requires an assessment of its joints and the associated soft tissues, vascular system, and nervous system. The lower extremities are evaluated on the basis of anatomic changes, diagnostic categories, and functional changes. Impairment evaluations pertain to conditions that have reached maximum medical improvement (MMI), as defined in Chapter 1 and the Glossary.\n\nThe following revisions have been made for the fifth edition: (1) The principles of assessment have been expanded to clarify when the different evaluation methods should be used; (2) a new table, Guide to the Appropriate Combination of Evaluation Methods (Table 17-2), has been added to indicate which methods are appropriate to use in combination;\n(3) the evaluation of causalgia and complex regional pain syndrome now follows the same principles used to evaluate central nervous system lesions;\n(4) additional case examples are provided; and (5) a lower extremity worksheet is provided as a template to simplify making the assessment and recording the evaluation.\n\n\n17.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.\n\nThe evaluation should include a comprehensive, accurate medical history; a review of all pertinent records; a comprehensive description of the individual\u2019s current symptoms and their relationship to daily activities; a careful and thorough physical examination; and all findings of relevant laboratory, radiologic (imaging), and ancillary tests. It is also essential that the rater include in the report a description of how the impairment was calculated. Because many ratings are reviewed by other physicians and third-party administrators, the explanation of the calculation will lead to a better understanding of the method used and the report will be considered more reliable.",
  "Section 203 - 3230 chars": "17.1 a Interpretation of Symptoms and Signs\nHistory\nThe case history should be based mainly on the individual\u2019s own statements rather than on secondhand information. The evaluator should consider information from other sources, including medical records. The physician should use this information cautiously, especially if it is subjective. It is not appropriate to question the individual\u2019s integrity. If information from the individual is inconsistent with what is known about the medical condition, the circumstances, or the written record, this should be reported and comment should be included about the inconsistencies.\n\nThe medical history must describe the chief complaint. Discuss the quality, frequency, duration, and anatomic location of pain, numbness, paresthesias, and weakness in detail. Further, report how the condition interferes with daily activities. The physician should elicit the facts about when and how the condition started and the relationship to any related problems elsewhere in the lower extremity or in other areas of the musculoskeletal system, such as the spine. The report should describe any precipitating events or factors.\n\nIdeally, include the individual\u2019s description as to how the symptoms developed and the assumed cause. In addition, discuss the results of special studies and treatment. The physician should review available xrays and other imaging studies personally or report the findings as being those of another reviewer (based on reports). A review of organ systems and of the general medical history can provide potentially helpful information, including complicating medical problems that can affect the diagnosis and care plan.\n\nExamination\nPhysical examination of nonmusculoskeletal areas (eg, the nervous system) is discussed in other parts of the Guides. A targeted neurologic assessment is needed for individuals with lower extremity problems. Guided by the history and physical examination, the physician records lower extremity\u2013related physical findings, such as range of motion, limb length discrepancy, deformity, reflexes, muscle strength and atrophy, ligamentous laxity, motor and sensory deficits, and specific diagnoses such as fractures and bursitis.\n\nNeurologic examination of the lower extremities includes measurement of knee and ankle reflexes and motor and sensory functions. It is important to ensure that lower extremity impairment discussed in this chapter is not due to underlying spine pathology. If lower extremity impairment is due to an underlying spine disorder, the lower extremity impairment would, in most cases, be accounted for in the spine impairment rating.\n\nThe Lower Extremities\n\n525\n\n\n17.1 b Description of Clinical Studies\nSpecific Lower Extremity Techniques\nThe physician needs to review and record findings from diagnostic studies, including laboratory tests, electromyographic, vascular, and roentgenographic studies, CT scans, and MRI studies with or without contrast. A summary of the studies should be included as a separate paragraph or section. While imaging and other studies may assist physicians in making a diagnosis and help determine the method for assessment, they are not the sole determinants.",
  "Section 204 - 3174 chars": "17.2 Methods of Assessment\nThirteen methods can be used to assess the lower extremities, as listed in Table 17-2. Table 17-1 classifies the 13 methods into three non\u2013mutually exclusive categories to reflect their primary mode of assessment: (1) anatomic, (2) functional, or (3) diagnosis based. Detailed discussions of each method are provided in the sections noted.\n\nAnatomic changes, including range of motion (ROM), any limb length discrepancy, arthritis, skin changes, amputation, muscle atrophy, nerve impairment, and vascular derangement are assessed in the physical examination and supported with clinical studies. Arthritis has its own diagnostic category, which applies to individuals with documented arthritis who are impaired by pain, weakness, or stiffness, but who have maintained functional ranges of motion. Arthritis is evaluated based on narrowing of the joint space as measured from x-rays. Causalgia and complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy) are evaluated using a combination of ROM and peripheral neurologic evaluation techniques.\n\nDiagnosis-based estimates are used to evaluate impairments caused by specific fractures and deformities, as well as ligamentous instability, bursitis, and various surgical procedures, including joint replacements and meniscectomies. In certain situations, diagnosis-based estimates are combined with other methods of assessment.\n\nFunctional impairments are chosen for conditions when anatomic changes are difficult to categorize or when functional implications have been documented. Functional impairments are assessed last.\n\nThe evaluator should read this chapter in its entirety and understand and follow the evaluation methods using the worksheet given in Figure 17-10 at the end of the chapter or a similar, comprehensive checklist. The evaluator\u2019s first step is to establish the diagnosis(es) and whether or not the individual has reached MMI. The next step is to identify each part of the lower extremity that might possibly warrant an impairment rating (pelvis, hip, thigh, etc, down to the toes). Figure 17-10 lists potential methods for each lower extremity part. The evaluator determines whether ROM impairment or other regional impairments are present for each relevant part and records the impairment values in the appropriate locations on the worksheet. The selection of the most specific method(s) and the appropriate combination are\nlater considerations.\nAfter all potentially impairing conditions have been identified and the correct ratings recorded, the evaluator should select the clinically most appropriate (ie, most specific) method(s) and record the estimated impairment for each. The cross-usage chart (Table 17-2) indicates which methods and resulting impairment ratings may be combined. It is the responsibility\n\nof the evaluating physician to explain in writing why a particular method(s) to assign the impairment rating was chosen. When uncertain about which method to choose, the evaluator should calculate the impairment using different alternatives and choose the method or combination of methods that gives the most clinically accurate impairment rating.",
  "Section 205 - 3361 chars": "X = Do not use these methods together for evaluating a single impairment. 0 = See specific instructions for CRPS of the lower extremity.\n\nThe Lower Extremities\n\n527\n\nTypically, one method will adequately characterize the impairment and its impact on the ability to perform ADL. In some cases, however, more than one method needs to be used to accurately assess all features of the impairment. When more than one rating method is used, the individual impairment ratings are combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\nAvoid combining methods that rate the same condition. Selecting the optimal approach or combining several methods requires judgment and experience. A careful examination and review of supporting material is essential to produce accurate and consistent results. If more than one method can be used, the method that provides the higher rating should be adopted.\n\n\n17.2 a Converting From Lower Extremity to Whole Person Impairment\nTo make this chapter easier to use, the tables in this chapter show the impairment percentages of the whole person, the lower extremity, and the specific lower extremity part together. The whole person impairments are not in parentheses; the lower limb impairment percents are in parentheses ( ); and, when applicable, the specific part impairments are in brackets [ ]. To calculate the lower extremity impairment percent from a specific part impairment percent (eg, foot), multiply by 0.7. To calculate whole person impairment from a lower extremity impairment, multiply by 0.4. These values are shown in Table 17-3.\nSome individuals may have several impairments involving different parts of the same lower extremity; others may have several impairments of the same lower extremity part. If there are several impairments involving different regions of the lower extremity (eg, the thigh and the foot), evaluate each impairment separately, convert these regional impairments to whole person impairments, and combine the whole person impairment rating using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). If there are multiple impairments within a region (eg, the toes and the ankle), combine these regional, lower extremity impairments of the foot and convert the combined foot impairment to a whole person impairment. Similarly, when using separate methods on the same region, combine the regional impairments before converting to a whole person impairment rating.\n\nThe 13 assessment methods listed in Table 17-1 are discussed separately below.\n\n\n17.2 b Limb Length Discrepancy\nTo determine limb length discrepancy, place the individual supine on the examination table with the legs in the same position, measure the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine and the medial malleolus on the involved side, and compare it with the opposite side. To identify where on the leg the discrepancy is, the knee is flexed to 90\u00b0 while the feet are kept flat on the table. If one knee is higher than the other, the tibia is longer on that leg. Another method sometimes used is to evaluate the level of the iliac crest when the individual is standing. This is not recommended because differences in iliac crest levels may be due to pelvic obliquity, flexion, or adduction deformity of the hip. When these reasons exist for the obliquity, it is referred to as apparent leg length discrepancy.",
  "Section 206 - 3652 chars": "Both clinical methods have at least a 0.5to 1.0-cm variance, and both measurements are difficult to perform in a person with pelvic angulation, knee flexion contracture, or significant ankle edema. For this reason, teleroentgenography is recommended. If surface measurements with a tape measure from the anterior superior iliac spine to medial malleolus are used, they should be repeated three times and averaged to reduce measurement error. Impairments from limb length discrepancy depend on the magnitude of the leg length difference and are provided in Table 17-4. When applicable, the leg length discrepancy impairment is combined with other impairments.\n\nIn case of shortening due to overriding or malalignment or fracture deformities, but not to include flexion or extension deformities, combine the following values with other functional sequelae, using the Combined Values Chart:\n\n\n1.25 cm (0-1/2 in) = 5% of lower extremity 1.25-2.5 cm (1/2-1 in) = 10% of lower extremity 2.5-3.75 cm (1-11/2 in) = 15% of lower extremity 3.75-5.0 cm (11/2-2 in) = 20% of lower extremity\n\nThe Lower Extremities\n\n529\n\nshortening results in an impairment of 5% of the leg, or 2% impairment of the whole person.\nBecause the teleroentgenography is more accurate than tape measurements, especially in an obese individual (as this person was), it is the preferred method of determining leg length. Limb shortening may be combined with other methods (eg, diagnosis of femur fracture, as listed in Table 17-2).\n\n\n17.2c Gait Derangement\nGait derangement is present with many different types of lower extremity impairments and is always secondary to another condition. An impairment rating due to a gait derangement should be supported by pathologic findings, such as x-rays. Except as otherwise noted, the percentages given in Table 17-5 are for full-time gait derangements of persons who are dependent on assistive devices.\n\nWhenever possible, the evaluator should use a more specific method. When the gait method is used, a written rationale should be included in the report.\nThe lower limb impairment percents shown in Table 17-5 stand alone and are not combined with any other impairment evaluation method.\n\nSection 17.2c does not apply to abnormalities based only on subjective factors, such as pain or sudden giving-way, as with, for example, an individual with low-back discomfort who chooses to use a cane to assist in walking.\n\n17.2d Muscle Atrophy (Unilateral)\nIn evaluating muscle atrophy, the leg circumference should be measured and compared to the opposite leg at equal distances from either the joint line or another palpable anatomic structure. For example, a thigh atrophy may involve measuring the thigh circumference with a tape measure 10 cm above the patella and comparing it to a similar measure on the other leg. Calf circumference is compared at the maximum level bilaterally. Neither limb should have swelling or varicosities that would invalidate the measurements. Diminished muscle function can be estimated using four different methods. Only one should be used; that is, use only one method for assessing muscle function. Atrophy ratings should not be combined with any of the other three possible ratings of diminished muscle function (gait derangement, muscle weakness, and peripheral nerve injury). When muscle dysfunction is present, assess the condition with all four methods. Use the method that most accurately and objectively reflects the individual\u2019s impairment. Atrophy at both the thigh and calf is evaluated separately and the whole person impairment combined. Impairment ratings from atrophy",
  "Section 207 - 3023 chars": "are provided in Table 17-6.\n\n\n17.2e Manual Muscle Testing\nManual muscle testing, which typically involves groups of muscles, depends on the examinee\u2019s cooperation and is subject to his or her conscious and unconscious control. To be valid, the results should be concordant with other observable pathologic signs and medical evidence. In general, this method is best used for pathology that does not have a primary neurologic basis, eg, a compartment syndrome or direct muscle trauma. Weakness caused by an identifiable motor deficit of a specific peripheral nerve should be assessed according to Section 17.2l, Peripheral Nerve Injuries.\n\nMeasurements can be made by one or two observers. If the measurements are made by one examiner, they should be consistent on different occasions. If made by two, they should be consistent between examiners. Even in a fully cooperative individual, strength may vary from one examination to another, but not by more than one grade. If they vary by more than one grade between observers, or by the same examiner on separate occasions, the measurement should be considered invalid. In those individuals, impairment estimates should not be made using this section.\nIndividuals whose performance is inhibited by pain or the fear of pain are not good candidates for manual muscle testing, and other evaluation methods should be considered for them. Table 17-7 shows the criteria on which estimates and grades of the lower extremity\u2019s strength are based, and Table 17-8 lists the actual ratings based on lower extremity weakness.\n\n17.2f Range of Motion\nLower extremity impairment can be evaluated by assessing the range of motion of its joints, recognizing that pain and motivation may affect the measurements. If it is clear to the evaluator that a restricted range of motion has an organic basis, three measurements should be obtained and the greatest range measured should be used. If multiple evaluations exist, and there is inconsistency of a rating class between the findings of two observers, or in the findings on separate occasions by the same observer, the results are considered invalid. Figures 17-1 to 17-6 illustrate one method of measuring range of motion in the lower extremity. The ranges listed in Tables\n\n17-9 through 17-14 are examples of mild, moderate, and severe impairments and are to be used as guides. Range-of-motion restrictions in multiple directions do increase the impairment. Add range-of-motion impairments for a single joint to determine the total joint range-of-motion impairments. For example, hip motion is evaluated and any impairment added in each of the six principal directions of motion.\nFigure 17-1 Using a Goniometer to Measure Flexion of the Right Hip*\n\n(a) Goniometer is placed at the right hip, and the pelvis is locked in the neutral position by flexing the left hip until the lumbar spine is flat.\n(b) Examinee flexes the right hip until the anterior superior iliac spine begins to move, when the angle is recorded.",
  "Section 208 - 3003 chars": "(c) To measure loss of extension of the right hip, the left hip is flexed until the lumbar spine is flat on the examining table, as determined by the examiner\u2019s hand, which is placed between the lumbar spine and table surface. The right thigh should rest flat on the table;\nany right hip flexion is recorded as a flexion contracture.\n\nFigure 17-3 Measuring Internal and External Hip Rotation*\n\nThe examinee is prone on a flat surface, and the knee is flexed 90\u00b0. One part of the goniometer is parallel to the flat surface, and the other is along the tibia.

Keep the pelvis flat on the table.\nNeutral\n\nFigure 17-5 Measuring Foot Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion\n\nThe goniometer\u2019s pivot is centered over the ankle, and one arm parallels the tibia. The examiner reads the angles subtending the maximum arcs of motion for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. The test is repeated with the knee flexed to 45\u00b0. The averages of the maximum angles represent dorsiflexion and plantar flexion ranges of motion.\n\nRosemont, Ill: American Orthopaedic Association; 1966.\n\nFigure 17-4 Measuring Knee Flexion\n\n(a) The examinee is supine and the goniometer is next to the knee joint; one goniometer arm is parallel to the lower leg, and the other is parallel to the femur.

The flexion angle is obtained from the goniometer.\nFigure 17-6 Evaluating the Range of Motion of a Toe: the Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) Joint of the Great Toe\n\n(a) The examinee is seated in the position for evaluation of the toes. The knee is flexed to 45\u00b0, and the foot and MTP joint are in the neutral position.\n(b) Extension: The goniometer is under the MTP joint, and its angle is read as a baseline. The examinee extends (dorsiflexes) the toe maximally, and the angle subtending the maximum arc of motion is read; the baseline angle is subtracted.\n(c) Flexion: The goniometer is placed over the MTP joint. The baseline angle is read. The examinee plantar flexes the MTP joint maximally. The angle subtending the maximum arc of motion is read, and the baseline angle is subtracted.\n\nThe Lower Extremities\n\n537\nRange-of-motion impairment values for the lower extremity are listed in Tables 17-9 to 17-14.\n\nThe maximum whole person impairment percent for impairment of two or more lesser toes of one foot is 2%.\n\n17.2g Joint Ankylosis\nAn immobile joint is an impairment even when the position of ankylosis is optimal. Malposition in angulation or rotation of an arthrodesed or fused joint increases the magnitude of the impairment.\nSurgical correction usually is preferable to accepting a significant malposition, but it is not always possible or practical. Impairment estimates for malposition are therefore included for the infrequently encountered individual who is not a candidate for surgical correction.",
  "Section 209 - 3104 chars": "The following text and Tables 17-15 through 17-30 indicate the optimal neutral positions for ankyloses of the lower extremity joints and provide the impairment percents for ankyloses in those optimal positions.\nAny variation from the optimal neutral position of an ankylosed joint increases the baseline impairment percent as indicated in the tables. The values listed are for the maximum end of the deformity range.\nSpecific deformities should be rated using interpolation of the ranges in the tables as illustrated by examples in this section. Multiple malposition deformities of the same joint, ie, angulation and malrotation, are added, whereas deformities of different joints are combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). The baseline rating for ankylosis in the neutral position is used only once for each joint. As noted elsewhere, added or combined impairment ratings can never exceed 100% of the lower extremity.\n\nHip\nThe optimal position of ankylosis is 25\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 flexion and neutral rotation, adduction, and abduction. This position represents a 20% whole person impairment and a 50% lower extremity impairment.\n\nTables 17-15 through 17-19 provide impairment estimates for hip ankyloses in various positions. See Figures 17-1 through 17-3 for illustration of the measurement of hip motion and ankylosis.\nImpairment estimates for rotation, abduction, and adduction deformities are added. The maximum hip impairment or lower limb impairment is 100%, which is a 40% whole person impairment.\nKnee\nThe optimal position is 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 of flexion with neutral alignment. Figure 17-4 shows how the goniometer is used to measure knee flexion. Ankylosis in the optimal position is a 67% lower extremity impairment or 27% whole person impairment.\n\nImpairments beyond those of the optimal position are evaluated according to Tables 17-20 through 17-23. Malpositions of the knee include varus, val-\ngus, and malrotation deformities, which can increase the impairment up to 100% impairment of the lower extremity.\n\nThe appropriate ankylosis impairment percent is added to the impairment percent for ankylosis in the neutral position given in the text.\nThe optimal ankylosis position is the neutral position without flexion, extension, varus, or valgus. Ankylosis of the ankle in the neutral position is a 4% whole person impairment, a 10% lower extremity impairment, and a 14% foot impairment. A variation from the neutral position should be evaluated according to Tables 17-24 through 17-28. The maximum impairments are 25% whole person impairment, 62% lower extremity impairment, and 88% ankle impairment.

The ankylosis impairment in the neutral position is 4% for the whole person, 10% for the lower extremity, and 14% for the foot. Malpositioning may increase the whole person impairment up to 25%.\nVarus or valgus malpositioning is estimated in the same way as for the ankle (Tables 17-25 and 17-26).\n\nAnkylosis impairment for loss of the tibia\u2013os calcis angle is estimated according to Table 17-29. The tibia\u2013os calcis angle is made by the longitudinal axis of the os calcis and the longitudinal axis of the tibia with the ankle in neutral position (Figure 17-7).\nFor pantalar ankylosis, the optimal position is neutral; the impairment estimates for that position are 10% for the whole person, 25% for the lower extremity, and 35% for the foot. Further flexion, varus, and valgus impairments are estimated as shown in Tables 17-25 to 17-29.\n\nToes\nFigure 17-6 illustrates the use of a goniometer to measure a toe\u2019s range of motion. Table 17-30 provides impairment estimates related to ankylosis of one or several toes.\n\n17.2h Arthritis\nRoentgenographic grading systems for inflammatory and degenerative arthritis are well established and widely used for treatment decisions and scientific investigation. For most individuals, roentgenographic grading is a more objective and valid method for assigning impairment estimates than physical findings, such as the range of motion or joint crepitation. While there are some individuals with arthritis for whom loss of motion is the principal impairment, most people are impaired more by pain and sometimes weakness, but they still can maintain functional ranges of motion, at least in the early stages of the process. Range-of-motion techniques are therefore of limited value for estimating impairment secondary to arthritis in many individuals. Crepitation is an inconstant finding that depends on such factors as forces on joint surfaces and synovial fluid viscosity.\n\nCertain roentgenographic findings that are of diagnostic importance, such as osteophytes and reactive sclerosis, have no direct bearing on impairment. The best roentgenographic indicator of disease stage and impairment for a person with arthritis is the cartilage interval or joint space. The hallmark of all types of arthritis is thinning of the articular cartilage; this correlates well with disease progression.\n\nThe need for joint replacement or major reconstruction usually corresponds with complete loss of the articular surface (joint space). The impairment estimates in a person with arthritis (Table 17-31) are based on standard x-rays taken with the individual standing, if possible. The ideal film-to-camera distance is 90 cm (36 in), and the beam should be at the level of and parallel to the joint surface. The estimate for the patellofemoral joint is based on a \u201csunrise view\u201d taken at 40\u00b0 flexion or on a true lateral view.",
  "Section 211 - 3033 chars": "In the case of the knee, the joint must be in neutral flexion-extension position (0\u00b0) to evaluate the x-rays. Impairments of individuals with knee flexion contractures should not be estimated using x-rays because measurements are unreliable. In these individuals, the range-of-motion method should be used. X-rays of the hip joint are taken in the neutral position. The cartilage interval (joint space) of the hip is relatively constant in the various positions; therefore, positioning is not as critical as for the knee x-rays.\nThe ankle x-ray must be taken in a mortise view, which is 10\u00b0 internal rotation: 10\u00b0 flexion or extension is permissible.

A good example is that of an individual impaired because of a successful replacement of a hip. This person may function well but require prophylactic restrictions of activities of daily living to prevent a further impairment, such as premature failure of the prosthesis.\nTable 17-33 provides impairment estimates for certain lower extremity impairments. For most diagnosis-based estimates, the ranges of impairment are broad, and the estimate will depend on the clinical manifestations and their impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living. Hip replacements should first be rated using Table 17-34 and knee replacements using Table 17-35. The points obtained from the assessment are then applied to Table 17-33 for the diagnosis impairment rating. If limb length discrepancy also exists, that impairment rating should be combined with the impairment from\nthe joint replacement using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\u2020 See Table 17-34 or Table 17-35 for point rating system.\n\u2021 A stress x-ray is an anterior-posterior view taken with a varus or valgus stress applied by a knowledgeable physician.\n\u00a7 The tibia\u2013os calcis angle is measured as shown in Figure 17-7.\n\nThe Lower Extremities\n\n547\n\nRegion and Condition\nTotal knee replacement including unicondylar replacement\nGood result, 85-100 points\u2020 Fair results, 50-84 points\u2020",

The evaluator should, in general, use only one approach for each anatomic part. There are, however, a few instances in which elements from both diagnostic and examination approaches will apply to a specific situation (see Figure 17-2). An individual with an acetabular fracture\n\nand a sciatic nerve palsy should have estimates made for both the hip joint impairment and the nerve palsy. The estimates for the fracture and the nerve condition are then combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604) to provide the final impairment estimate. The final lower extremity impairment cannot exceed the impairment estimate for amputation of the extremity (100%), or 40% whole person impairment.\n\nFractures in and about joints with degenerative changes should be rated either by using this section and combining the rating with that for arthritis (Table 17-31 and Combined Values Chart, p. 604) or by using the loss of range-of-motion method. It is recommended that the method providing the greater of the two impairment estimates be used. A diagnosis of isolated full-thickness articular cartilage defects and ununited osteochondral fractures requires arthroscopic or surgical confirmation.\n\n17.2k Skin Loss\nFull-thickness skin loss about certain areas in the lower extremity results in significant impairment, as shown in Table 17-36, even when the areas are successfully covered with an appropriate type of skin graft. Chronic osteomyelitis is also evaluated using this method.\n\n\n17.2l Peripheral Nerve Injuries\nPeripheral nerve injuries are divided into two components: motor deficits and sensory deficits. Figures 17-8 and 17-9 show the sensory and motor nerves of the lower extremity. All estimates listed in Table 17-37 are for complete motor or sensory loss for the named peripheral nerves. Partial sensory and motor deficits should be rated as in the upper extremity (Tables 16-10 and 16-11). First identify the injured",
  "Section 213 - 3014 chars": "nerve and find the maximum impairment of the lower extremity due to motor deficit in Table 17-37. Grade the severity of motor deficit of the individual muscle groups innervated by that nerve according to the classification given in Table 16-11. Assign a motor deficit concordant with that grade and multiply the maximum impairment value of the nerve for motor loss by the percent motor deficit to obtain the lower extremity impairment for this partial loss. Sensory deficits follow a similar method, as described in Table 16-10.\nMotor and sensory estimates should be combined, but impairments from multiple peripheral nerve injuries should not exceed the whole person impairment from complete loss of a lower extremity (40%).\n\nThe Lower Extremities\n\n551\nSensory deficits, including dysesthesias, are subjective and must be carefully evaluated. Ideally, two examiners should agree. Estimates for peripheral nerve impairments may be combined with those for other types of lower extremity impairments, except those for muscle weakness, atrophy, and gait derangement, using the Combined Values Chart\n(p. 604). See cross-usage Table 17-2.\n\nThe Lower Extremities\n\n553\n\n\n17.2m Causalgia and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy)\nCausalgia is a burning pain resulting from injury of a peripheral nerve. As a term, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is preferred to reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) because the relationship to the sympathetic nervous system is uncertain. CRPS is characterized by pain, swelling, stiffness, discoloration, and skeletal demineralization, and it may follow a sprain, fracture or nerve or vascular injury. CRPS is further described in Section 13.8.\nWhen causalgia or CRPS occurs in an extremity, the evaluator should use the method described in Chapter 13, The Central and Peripheral Nervous System.\n\n\n17.2n Vascular Disorders\nTable 17-38 classifies and provides criteria for impairments due to peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity. When amputation due to peripheral vascular disease is involved, the impairment due to amputation should be evaluated according to the criteria in section 17.2i, and the impairment percent should be combined (Combined Values Chart, p. 604) with an appropriate percent based on Table 17-38 for the remaining vascular disease.\nThe Lower Extremities\n\n555\n\n\n17.3 Lower Extremity Impairment Evaluation Procedure Summary and Examples\nWhen evaluating an individual with lower extremity impairment, first obtain the person\u2019s detailed history and perform a thorough and careful physical examination, then follow the steps suggested below.\n\n\n1.

Select the most appropriate method(s) based on the history and physical examination. Use the cross-usage table (Table 17-2) to ensure only the proper methods are combined. Although diminished muscle function can be evaluated by means of four methods (peripheral nervous system impairment, atrophy, manual muscle testing, or gait), use only the method that has the greatest specificity (eg, a peripheral nerve injury, if present). Anatomically based, specific methods are used to evaluate skin loss and osteomyelitis (Section 17.2k), peripheral nerve injuries (Section 17.2l), and vascular disorders (Section 17.2n). If a vascular impairment results in an amputation, any remaining vascular and amputation impairments are combined. Neurologic and vascular impairments are recorded separately since they are not limited to one region of the lower extremity. Gait derangements should be used only infrequently, when other, more specific measures are not appropriate.\n\n10. If there are several alternatives, use the grouping that provides the greatest impairment percent. Convert a lower extremity impairment rating to whole person impairment using the appropriate tables. Combine whole person impairments for each injury/illness for the same extremity using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).\n\n11.

Thus, the lower extremity amputation impairment rating must be used, not the foot impairment rating. Calculating the whole person impairment by combining the lower extremity impairments and multiplying by 0.4 should be the same as converting each lower extremity impairment to whole person impairment and then combining the whole person impairments.

Using Table 16-10 from The Upper Extremities as a guide, take the sensory deficit in the 25% sensory deficit category.

  "Section 217 - 3031 chars": "This chapter has been completely revised from the fourth edition. Its new features include (1) an overview of pain; (2) a discussion of the complexity of assessing impairment due to pain; (3) a review of situations in which pain is a major cause of suffering, dysfunction, or medical intervention rather than a part of injuries and illnesses of specific organ systems as covered in other chapters of the Guides; (4) a qualitative method for evaluating impairment due to chronic pain; and (5) a description of when to use the methods described in this chapter and how they can be integrated with the impairment rating methods used in other chapters of the Guides.\nPhysicians need to use their clinical judgment as to what constitutes normal or expected pain in conditions that produce widely variable amounts of pain; a herniated lumbar disk, for example, may be completely painless or incapacitatingly painful. This chapter focuses on those situations in which the pain itself is a major cause of suffering, dysfunction, or medical intervention. Pain as considered in this chapter is persistent, which is not to say that it is refractory to all treatment, but that it is likely to be permanent and stationary.\n\n\n18.1 Principles of Assessment\nBefore using the information in this chapter, the Guides user should become familiar with Chapters 1 and 2 and the Glossary. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the Guides\u2019 purpose, applications, and methods for performing and reporting impairment evaluations. The Glossary provides definitions of common terms used by many specialties in impairment evaluation.\n\nIt is considerably more difficult to provide a method for assessing chronic, persistent pain than acute pain. In chronic pain states, there is often no demonstrable active disease or unhealed injury, and the autonomic changes that accompany acute pain, even in the anesthetized individual, are typically absent. Historically, it was assumed that pain derived from underlying peripheral tissue pathology and that its severity should correlate highly with the identified pathology. Current research, however, shows that pain perception is less a moment-to-moment analysis of afferent input than a dynamic process influenced by the effects of past experiences. Sensory stimuli act on neural systems that have been modified by earlier inputs, and the output of these systems is significantly influenced by the \u201cmemory\u201d\nof these prior events.\n\n\n18.2  Overview of Pain\n\n18.2a Definitions\nPain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain1 as \u201can unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.\u201d\n\nPain is a plural concept with biological, psychological, and social components. Its perception is influenced by cognitive, behavioral, environmental, and cultural factors. At first glance, it seems at odds with scientific medicine because of the difficulty accounting for it with obvious pathophysiologic changes.",
  "Section 218 - 3254 chars": "Pain is subjective. Its presence cannot be readily validated or objectively measured. Physicians are confronted with ambiguity as they attempt to assess the severity and significance of chronic pain in their patients. In large part, this stems from the fundamental divide between a person who suffers from pain and an observer who attempts to understand that suffering. Observers tend to view pain complaints with suspicion and disbelief, akin to complaints of dizziness, fatigue, and malaise. As Scarry remarked, \u201cTo have great pain is to have certainty, to hear that another person has pain is to have doubt.\u201d2\n\nThe concept of chronic pain as an extension of acute nociceptive pain is not valid. Chronic pain is an evolving process in which injury may produce one pathogenic mechanism, which in turn produces others, so that the cause(s) of pain change over time.\nSupport for this concept includes evidence that primary afferent discharge actually has the ability to injure or kill spinal inhibitory neurons (excitotoxicity), leading to hyperexcitability due to disinhibition. Peripheral nerve injury can initiate evolving abnormalities in spinal cord neurons, which in turn generate abnormal responsiveness of thalamic neurons, which in turn generate cortical dysfunction. In time, these higher-level abnormalities may become independent of the abnormalities that produced them.3\n\nEven in situations that might be expected to provide clear correlations between perceived pain and identified peripheral pathology, there are perplexing observations. For example, in up to 85% of individuals who report back pain, no pain-producing pathology can be identified4; conversely, some 30% of asymptomatic people have significant pathology on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)5 and computed tomographic (CT) scans6 that might be expected to cause pain. Headache is another common disabling condition in which impairment must be assessed primarily on the basis of individuals\u2019 reports of pain rather than on tissue pathology or anatomic abnormality. The reason is straightforward: in the majority of cases there is no demonstrable tissue pathology. Thus, pain can exist without tissue damage, and tissue damage can exist without pain. In summary, there is no \u201cpain thermometer,\u201d that is, no biological measure that correlates highly with individuals\u2019 complaints of pain.\n\n\n18.2b Impact of Pain on Population Health and Disability\nPain is among the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, accounting for more than 70 million office visits to physicians each year.7 It is also the most common cause of disability, with chronic low back pain alone accounting for more disability than any other condition, resulting in nearly 150 million lost work days in 1988.8 Disability related to back pain has increased dramatically, although there is no reason to suspect that back problems by themselves have increased.9,10 Headache disorders are also a major cause of work loss.11 Despite advances in physiologic understanding, surgical interventions, and pharmacologic therapies, the prevalence of chronic pain shows no signs of abating and continues to be of epidemic proportions. Notwithstanding this fact, the importance of pain is often discounted.",
  "Section 219 - 3644 chars": "Morris has averred that pain reported by somebody else falls into the category we reserve for whatever is invisible, subjective, immaterial, and therefore unreal.12 A 1987 report of the Social Security Administration opined that it is impossible to understand the pain that another person is suffering.13\n\nPain is an essential determinant of the incapacitation of many individuals who undergo impairment evaluation. As observed by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Pain and Disability and Chronic Illness Behavior,14 \u201cThe notion that all impairments should be verifiable by objective evidence is administratively necessary for an entitlement program. Yet this notion is fundamentally at odds with a realistic understanding of how disease and injury operate to incapacitate people. Except for a very few conditions, such as the loss of a limb, blindness, deafness, paralysis, or coma, most diseases and injuries do not prevent people from working by mechanical failure. Rather, people are incapacitated by a variety of unbearable sensations when they try to work.\u201d\n\nWhen pain persists, it has the capacity to dominate a person\u2019s existence, contributing to significant impairment, reduction in the quality of life, functional limitations, and disability. The ravages of chronic pain often extend beyond the person who has it, as the lives of family members are often dominated by the pain of a loved one. Indeed, the children of individuals with chronic pain are at risk for suffering a similar fate.15 In addition to the human costs, chronic pain is extremely costly to society. Medical expenditures for pain-related assessment and treatment, indemnity costs, loss of productivity, and loss of tax revenues are estimated to be $125 billion each year in the United States.16\n\n18.2\nc Medical Advances in Understanding and Managing Pain Behavioral/Psychological\nSeveral major currents of thought and investigation in the last three decades have profoundly altered medical understanding of pain and its associated behaviors. The first was the behavioral hypothesis that much of the behavior associated with chronic pain was not intrinsic to a disease or injury but, rather, reflected environmental contingencies.17 This development led to the introduction of powerful clinical interventions, but it had the unfortunate effect of increasing skepticism about the validity of the suffering in those with persistent pain.\n\nThe considerable role of cognitive factors and coping skills in augmenting and mitigating the suffering and dysfunction of chronic pain has been compellingly demonstrated. These insights have provided the foundation of efficacious treatments.18\n\nAssociated with these developments has been the introduction of the term chronic pain syndrome (CPS) into common parlance. Although not official nomenclature, it is frequently used to describe an individual who is markedly impaired by chronic pain with substantial psychological overlay.19 CPS is largely a behavioral syndrome that affects a minority of those with chronic pain. It may best be understood as a form of abnormal illness behavior that consists mainly of excessive adoption of the sick role. The term is useful in that it properly directs therapy toward the reversal of regression and away from an exclusive focus on elimination of nociception. It does not, however, substitute for a careful diagnosis of the physiologic, psychological, and conditioning components that comprise the syndrome. The term CPS must be used with caution, as grouping pain problems together under a generic disorder may mask and leave untreated important physiologic differences.",
  "Section 220 - 3479 chars": "Neurophysiologic\nA second major current has derived from explosive growth in our understanding of the pathophysiology of pain, which has rendered many older concepts untenable. Processes of peripheral and central sensitization have been clarified, along with such phenomena as the development of adrenergic sensitivity in injured nociceptive fibers and the accumulation of ion channels at sites of nerve injury, all of which may produce severe pain in response to trivial stimulation. Processes have been identified by which unilateral inflammation, trauma, or illness can lead to pain and sensitivity in uninvolved, often contralateral, structures. Physiologic\n\nprocesses underlying such symptoms, which were often dismissed as \u201cnot real,\u201d have been found at the level of the dorsal horn, thalamus, and sensory cortex. Intense stimulation and peripheral nerve damage have been found to induce persistent changes in the spinal cord that, over time, alter the receptive field mapping and the phenotype of neurons rostral to them, which in turn may induce changes at the cortical level. These findings are of major import. They demonstrate that pain need not be symptomatic of a disease or injury but, in fact, can become a disease unto itself.\n\nA major implication of recent research on sensitization is that the failure of medical and surgical investigation to account for a given pain may result not from looking in the wrong place, but from looking at the wrong time. That is, the investigations may be directed toward the organ or body part that was historically responsible for the individual\u2019s pain, but they may be unrevealing because the pain, having been initiated by an injury or illness in the past, is now relatively independent.\n\nAlthough sensitization of the peripheral and central nervous system has been demonstrated repeatedly in basic neuroscience research, there are currently no widely accepted methods for determining whether the symptoms of an individual with chronic pain can be ascribed to sensitization. Thus, while the concept of sensitization is extremely important to a conceptual understanding of chronic pain, there is currently no systematic way to incorporate it into impairment ratings.\n\nImplications\nThe scientific advances described above have important implications for the assessment of pain-related impairment. The AMA Guides as a whole embodies the premise that injuries and illnesses cause deficits in the functioning of organs or body parts, and these deficits can be quantitatively assessed during an impairment evaluation. In the simplest situations, an individual experiences a definite biological insult that creates a clear-cut abnormality in his or her biological functioning. This abnormality, in turn, leads directly to deficits in activities of daily living (ADL) that can be quantified during the course of an impairment evaluation. An example is an individual who sustains a below-elbow amputation in a sawmill accident.\n\nThe behavioral concept of CPS and the neurophysiologic concept of peripheral or central nervous system sensitization imply that pain and pain-related activity restrictions may be dissociated from the biological insult to which a person was exposed and from any measurable biological dysfunction in that person\u2019s organs or body parts. Both concepts thus challenge the assumed linkages among biological insult, organ or body part dysfunction, and ADL deficits that are fundamental to the AMA rating system.",
  "Section 221 - 3681 chars": "Physicians differ sharply in the way in which they conceptualize the relations among biological insult, measurable organ or body part dysfunction, and selfreported activity limitations in individuals with chronic pain. Some physicians have a low threshold for using diagnoses like \u201cchronic pain syndrome\u201d or \u201cpsychogenic pain\u201d to describe these people. The diagnoses highlight the lack of association between the complaints of the individuals and any welldefined biological abnormality.\n\nOther physicians attempt to link the complaints of pain patients to a biological abnormality. In general, they do this by employing one of two strategies. The first is to view the person as having an atypical presentation of a well-accepted syndrome. For example, thoracic outlet syndrome is a well-recognized condition that can be caused by measurable abnormalities in arterial, venous, or neural structures in the thoracic outlet. Some physicians view people with chronic pain and paresthesias in an upper extremity as having a variant of thoracic outlet syndrome, even though vascular studies and electrodiagnostic studies are either normal or equivocal.20 The other strategy is to construct diagnoses based on the person\u2019s symptoms and on subjective physical examination findings. The assumption of physicians employing this strategy is that a biological underpinning for the symptoms exists, but that medical science has not yet identified it. For example, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia is based on individuals\u2019 reports of widespread pain and their reports of tenderness during physical examination. Despite extensive research, no specific underlying biological abnormality has been discovered to explain the reports of these people.\n\nAcrimonious debates have occurred between physicians who favor biological explanations for controversial pain syndromes and those who construe the syndromes as dissociated from any definable biological abnormality. The interpretation has significant practical implications because many of the administrative agencies that provide benefits for people\nwith impairments emphasize the importance of\n(1) objective findings of biological dysfunction and\n(2) a clear causal link between an index injury and an individual\u2019s present symptoms and findings.\nIf a painful condition is construed as a CPS or a psychogenic pain syndrome, both of these criteria are violated.\n\nThe distinction between well-accepted conditions and those that are ambiguous or controversial is itself ambiguous. Sometimes disagreements arise about individuals with atypical presentations of well-recognized painful syndromes. The example of thoracic outlet syndrome was given above. Another example is a person with chronic low back pain,\nvague symptoms in one lower extremity, and an MRI with questionable compromise of a lumbar nerve root. The person might be described as having an atypical presentation of a lumbar radiculopathy; an alternative assessment is that the individual has a nonspecific chronic pain syndrome involving the low back. In other instances, disagreements center around the validity of the diagnostic procedures used to diagnose conditions. For example, a practitioner of manual medicine might ascribe an individual\u2019s back pain to a lumbar subluxation or torsion of the ilium, whereas physicians not practiced in manual medicine might discount these diagnoses because they do not accept the validity of the physical examination maneuvers underlying them. Finally, as in the case of fibromyalgia, reliable diagnostic criteria exist, but physicians disagree about whether the condition diagnosed by use of these criteria has a specific, definable biologic basis.",
  "Section 222 - 3972 chars": "The controversies described above cannot be resolved in this chapter of the Guides for the simple reason that the medical community has not achieved consensus about how to construe such conditions as myofascial pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, and \u201cdisputed neurogenic\u201d thoracic outlet syndrome.20 A practical approach for performing impairment ratings on individuals with ambiguous or controversial syndromes is given below.\n\n18.3\nIntegrating PainRelated Impairment Into the Conventional Impairment Rating System\nThere are several difficulties associated with integrating pain-related impairment into an impairment rating system such as the Guides. A basic challenge for a system of rating pain-related impairment is to incorporate the subjectivity associated with pain into an impairment rating system whose fundamental premise is that impairment assessment should be based on objective findings. The inherent subjectivity of pain is incongruent with the Guides\u2019 attempts to assess impairment on the basis of objective measures of organ dysfunction, as it requires that determinations of pain intensity and the restrictions imposed by it must be largely based on patients\u2019 reports.\n\nA second issue is that an individual\u2019s pain behaviors are influenced by his or her social environment.\nImpairment ratings are usually performed not to establish academic facts or to make treatment decisions but, rather, to establish the financial obligations of payers to individuals or, conversely, the entitlements of individuals to monetary rewards. Thus, the social context surrounding impairment ratings might provide an incentive for individuals to exaggerate their reports of pain so as to maximize awards.\nConversely, since insurance companies and government agencies often hire the professionals who perform impairment ratings, evaluators may have an incentive to doubt the complaints of individuals. An ideal rating system would validate the genuine suffering of individuals and resist influence by those who exaggerate their incapacitation for secondary gain. In the absence of objective criteria for assessing the severity and functional significance of pain, it has proved exceedingly difficult to achieve this goal.\n\nThird, this chapter assesses pain qualitatively. Because percentages for pain-related impairment have not been used and tested on a widespread basis, as have other impairment ratings used in the Guides, it was decided that impairment ratings for pain disorders would not be expressed as percentages of whole person impairment. Future scientific evidence may emerge that will enable a more quantifiable approach to be adopted. Nevertheless, the value of a qualitative assessment is that any identification of a significant pain component warrants additional consideration when interpreting impairment ratings used for allocation of medical resources, work placement, or financial compensation.\n\nFinally, at a practical level, a chapter of the Guides devoted to pain-related impairment should not be redundant of or inconsistent with principles of impairment rating described in other chapters. The Guides\u2019 impairment ratings currently include allowances for the pain that individuals typically experience when they suffer from various injuries or diseases, as articulated in Chapter 1 of the Guides: \u201cPhysicians recognize the local and distant pain that commonly accompanies many disorders. Impairment ratings in the Guides already have accounted for pain. For example, when a cervical spine disorder produces radiating pain down the arm, the arm pain, which is commonly seen, has been accounted for in the cervical spine impairment rating\u201d (p. 10). Thus, if an examining physician determines that an individual has pain-related impairment, he or she will have the additional task of deciding whether or not that impairment has already been adequately incorporated into the rating the person has received on the basis of other chapters of the Guides.",
  "Section 223 - 3236 chars": "18.3a When This Chapter Should Be Used to Evaluate Pain-Related Impairment\nOrgan and body system ratings of impairment should be used whenever they adequately capture the actual ADL deficits that individuals experience. However, the organ and body system impairment rating does not adequately address impairment in several situations, discussed below.\n\nWhen There Is Excess Pain in the Context of Verifiable Medical Conditions That Cause Pain Individuals in this group have pain associated with medical conditions that are verifiable by objective means. An example is an individual with a persistent lumbar radiculopathy following a lumbar diskectomy. Such an individual will usually have objective findings, including atrophy of the affected leg, muscle weakness, and MRI evidence of epidural scarring. An individual with these findings would receive an impairment rating of 10% on the basis of the DRE spine impairment rating system described in Chapter\n\n15. Although the DRE rating is usually appropriate, some individuals with persistent lumbar radiculopathies report \u201cexcess\u201d pain. That is, they report that their pain causes severe ADL deficits, suggesting a level of impairment greater than 10%. Procedures in this chapter can be used to assess this additional impairment and to classify it as mild, moderate, moderately severe, or severe.\n\nWhen There Are Well-Established Pain Syndromes Without Significant, Identifiable Organ Dysfunction to Explain the Pain Individuals in this group have pain syndromes that are widely accepted by physicians based on the individuals\u2019 clinical presentation but that are not associated with definable tissue pathology. These syndromes are not ratable under the conventional rating system and also they do not fit any of the other chapters in the Guides since there is no measurable organ dysfunction. Individuals with these well-established pain syndromes can be evaluated on the basis of concepts elaborated in this chapter. These individuals must have symptoms and signs that can plausibly be attributed to a well-defined medical condition. Some of the most common of these syndromes are listed in Table 18-1. The list is not comprehensive and may change as the body of medical information about various pain syndromes grows. If an examiner determines that an individual has a diagnosis that is not\non the list, he or she may rate the individual\u2019s pain-\nrelated impairment if he or she is convinced that the diagnosed condition is well recognized and that the pain-related impairment is a consequence of the condition. An explanation should be provided in writing.\n\nWhen There Are Other Associated Pain Syndromes\nUse this chapter to evaluate pain-related impairment when dealing with syndromes with the following characteristics: (a) They are associated with identifiable organ dysfunction that is ratable according to other chapters in the Guides; (b) they may be associated with well-established pain syndromes, but the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the pain syndromes is not predictable; so that (c) the impairment ratings provided in other chapters of the Guides do not capture the added burden of illness borne by individuals who have the associated pain syndromes.",
  "Section 224 - 3092 chars": "If the answer to all three of the above questions is yes, the examiner should consider the individual\u2019s pain-related impairment to be ratable and should proceed according to the rating protocol described in Section 18.3d. If the answer to any of the above three questions is no, the examiner should consider the individual\u2019s pain-related impairment to be unratable on the basis of concepts in this chapter. In that instance, he or she should still use the assessment protocol described in Section 18.3d to determine the severity and impact of the individual\u2019s pain and report the results. That is, even if the examiner considers the person to have unratable pain, he or she needs to characterize the apparent pain-related impairment.\n\nThe fact that pain-related impairment may be unratable either on the basis of the organ and body rating system or on the basis of this chapter highlights the limits that exist in the science and practice of impairment evaluation. The judgment that pain-related impairment is unratable does not mean that the evaluating physician considers the pain to be \u201cunreal\u201d or fabricated. In fact, individuals with ambiguous or controversial pain syndromes may suffer from severe pain and report significant restrictions in ADL. These reports are often corroborated by information provided by family members and treating physicians.\nThus, when a physician judges pain-related impairment to be unratable, he or she is simply asserting an inability to determine how the activity restrictions reported by an individual are linked to a disease or injury. The decision regarding how to construe these reports must therefore be administrative, not medical.\n\nAdvances in diagnostic technology and clinical experience may eventually make pain-related impairment rating feasible for individuals with ambiguous or controversial pain syndromes. At the present time, however, the best option available to an examiner is to report that the individual has apparent impairment that is unratable on the basis of current medical knowledge. Insurance companies and administrative agencies that dispense benefits for impairments will need to make the final decision about how to use this information.\n\n\n18.3c Administrative Issues Associated With Pain-Related Impairment\nIn essence, this chapter divides apparent impairment into three categories: (1) impairment ratable on the basis of the conventional rating system used throughout Guides Chapters 3 through 17; (2) pain-related impairment ratable according to concepts outlined in this chapter; and (3) pain-related impairment that is unratable according to the concepts outlined in this chapter.\n\nThere are two major reasons why these distinctions are crucial. First, agencies that provide benefits for individuals with impairments function under different legal mandates with respect to pain-related impairment. For example, workers\u2019 compensation laws in some states mandate that pain-related impairment be considered in disability awards for injured workers.21 In other states pain-related impairment is not considered.22",
  "Section 225 - 3009 chars": "The system described here distinguishes between an impairment rating using the organ system approach and impairment awarded on the basis of pain. This distinction permits administrative agencies to count \u201cconventional\u201d impairment ratings and pain-related impairment ratings on an equal footing, to discount pain-related impairment ratings, or to disregard them entirely. Similarly, the present system identifies individuals with unratable pain-related impairment so that administrative agencies can make informed decisions about whether or not to compensate these individuals.\n\nSecond, the distinction between ratable and unratable pain-related impairment embodies a key premise of this chapter: physicians do not currently possess reliable, valid techniques for assessing impairment associated with pain in all clinical settings. It is then more appropriate for the examining physician to describe the individual\u2019s pain-related impairment as unratable than to give a rating that cannot be supported by either scientific evidence or consensus.\n\n\n18.3d How to Rate Pain-Related Impairment: Overview\nThe system described in this chapter relies largely on self-reports by individuals. Thus, it differs significantly from the conventional rating system, which relies primarily on objective indices of organ dysfunction or failure. The present system assesses pain intensity, emotional distress related to pain, and ADL deficits secondary to pain. ADL deficits are given the greatest weight. An individual\u2019s pain-related impairment is considered unratable if (a) his or her behavior during the evaluation raises significant issues of credibility, (b) he or she has clinical findings atypical of a well-accepted medical condition, or (c) he or she is diagnosed with a condition that is vague or controversial.\n\nA detailed protocol for assessing pain-related impairment is described below and outlined in Figure 18-1.\n\nA. Evaluate the individual according to the body or organ rating system, and determine an impairment percentage. During the evaluation, the examiner should informally assess pain-related impairment.\nB. If the body system impairment rating appears to adequately encompass the pain experienced by the individual due to his or her medical condition, his or her impairment rating is as indicated by the body system impairment rating.\nC.\nIf the individual appears to have pain-related impairment that has increased the burden of his or her condition slightly, the examiner may increase the percentage found in A by up to 3%.\nD. The examiner should perform a formal painrelated impairment assessment if any of the following conditions are met:\n\n1) The individual appears to have pain-related impairment that is substantially in excess of the impairment determined in step A\nor\n\n2) The individual has a well-recognized medical condition that is characterized by pain in the absence of measurable dysfunction of an organ or body part (see Table 18-1 for examples)\nor\n",
  "Section 226 - 3018 chars": "3) The individual has a syndrome with the following characteristics: (a) it is associated with identifiable organ dysfunction that is ratable according to other chapters in the Guides; (b) it may be associated with a well-established pain syndrome, but the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the pain syndrome is not predictable; so that (c) the impairment ratings provided in step A do not capture the added burden of illness borne by the individual because of his or her associated pain syndrome (see Table 18-2 for examples).\nE. If the examiner performs a formal pain-related impairment rating, he or she may increase the percentage found in step A by up to 3%, and he or she should classify the individual\u2019s pain-related impairment into one of four categories: mild, moderate, moderately severe, or severe. In addition, the examiner should determine whether the pain-related impairment is ratable or unratable.\n\nTable 18-3 Impairment Classification Due to Pain Disorders\n\nClass 1 Mild\nPain severity, based on a combination of intensity and frequency, is mild\nIndividual\u2019s pain is mildly aggravated by performing ADL; is able to perform them with few modifications\nIndividual demonstrates no or only minimal emotional distress in response to his or her pain\nIndividual is not receiving treatment for pain on a regular basis\nPain-related limitations during physical examination are mild and appear appropriate; few pain behaviors (overt expressions of pain, distress, and suffering, such as moaning, limping, moving in a guarded fashion, facial grimacing) are observed during examination\n\nClass 2 Moderate\nPain severity, based on a combination of intensity and frequency, is moderate\nIndividual has moderate difficulty managing ADL; must make significant modifications in order to perform them (eg, move to a ground floor apartment, buy a car with automatic transmission)\nIndividual demonstrates mild to moderate affective distress in relation to his or her pain\nIndividual requires ongoing medical monitoring and is taking medication much of the time\nIndividual demonstrates significant pain-related limitations on physical examination; relatively few pain behaviors appear during the examination, and they are of indeterminate appropriateness\n\nClass 3 Moderately Severe\nPain is present most of the time and may reach an intensity of\n\n9-10/10\nIndividual can perform ADL only with substantial modifications; unable to perform many routine activities (eg, driving a car)\nIndividual demonstrates moderate to severe affective distress in relation to his or her pain\nIndividual receives medication to control pain on a maintenance basis\nOn physical examination, individual demonstrates severe painrelated limitations that may make the examination difficult to perform and results difficult to interpret\nA number of pain behaviors are observed during the examination, and they appear to be congruent with organ dysfunction\n\nClass 4 Severe\nPain is essentially continuous, with intensity reaching 9-10/10 at its worst",
  "Section 227 - 3006 chars": "Individual must either get help from others for many ADL (eg, preparing food, dressing), modify them drastically (eg, stop bathing), or spend an inordinate amount of time accomplishing them (eg, 2 hours to get out of bed and dressed)\nIndividual demonstrates severe affective distress in relation to his or her pain and communicates the perception that the pain is completely out of control\nIndividual is receiving maximal pharmacologic support for his or her pain on an ongoing basis\nPhysical examination is virtually impossible to perform because individual is intolerant of many examination maneuvers (eg, refuses to ambulate or to allow examiner to palpate symptomatic area); a significant number of pain behaviors are observed during the examination, and they appear to be congruent with organ dysfunction\n\n\n18.3e Classes of Pain-Related Impairment There are four general classes of impairment due to pain: class 1, mild; class 2, moderate; class 3, moderately severe; and class 4, severe (see Table 18-3).\n\n\n18.3f How to Rate Pain-Related Impairment: Practical Steps\nThere are six steps in the pain-related impairment evaluation process, each discussed below. Several alternative methods are available to evaluate the severity of pain, activity restrictions, emotional distress, and pain behaviors, some of which are discussed subsequently. One such methodology is provided\nin Table 18-4. The first three parts of the protocol included in Table 18-4 rely on the individual\u2019s\n\nself-report. The questions may be provided to the individual to complete on his or her own, or they can be presented in interview format. If the individual is asked to complete the questionnaire on his or her own, someone should be available to answer questions and to review the completed form to make sure the individual has responded to all the items. If the individual has a question about completion of any of the items in Sections I to III, he or she should be instructed to make the best estimate possible. Although Table 18-4 provides a numerical score, this should not be misunderstood to represent a quantitative impairment rating, but rather is used to classify individuals into the four qualitative classes. To that purpose, alternative methods may be used so long as they are valid and appropriately referred to in the report.\n\nTable 18-4 Ratings Determining Impairment Associated With Pain\n\nI.

A person should\nnot be judged medically stable, and therefore ratable, unless he or she has undergone a thorough evaluation for the entire range of factors that can affect pain\nand has undergone a vigorous trial of rehabilitative treatment.\n\nFor example, there may be no further orthopedic interventions available for a lumbar pseudarthrosis. Spinal arachnoiditis may be refractory to any intervention. Yet in both cases, appropriate pain management may reduce all the components of impairment, with reduced pain severity, functional restoration, and mood normalization. Consultation with a specialist in pain medicine may be required to determine whether the impairment is fixed or potentially useful treatments are available.\n\nDetermine the Severity of the Pain\nAlthough absolute quantification of pain is not possible, severity may be estimated using, for example, a visual analog scale, a numeric, or a box-rating scale. A horizontal or vertical line of known length is anchored by \u201cno pain at all\u201d at one end and \u201cworst pain ever\u201d at the other. A line of consecutive boxes also anchored with these end points, with a number in each one and in which the individual is asked to place an \u201cX\u201d in the box, may be of particular use because some people have difficulty understanding how to use a VAS scale.23 It is useful to obtain least, worst, and current levels, as well as the usual level. Exacerbating and mitigating factors should be sought. The character or quality of pain may assist with diagnosis and help establish that the pain is compatible with a known medical syndrome.",
  "Section 230 - 3522 chars": "The McGill Pain Questionnaire is widely used in pain medicine. It contains lists of words chosen to reflect the sensory (eg, dull, cramping), affective (eg, agonizing, terrifying), and evaluative (eg, annoying, unbearable) components of the pain experience.24 There are also descriptors of the temporal qualities of the pain (momentary, steady, intermittent). Line drawings of the body permit the individual to shade in the location of the pain. Numeric descriptors of the overall present pain intensity are provided (1 = mild, 2 = discomforting, 3 = distressing, 4 = horrible, 5 = excruciating).\n\nDetermine Activity Restrictions\nThe reported severity of pain may not correlate well with its functional impact. Indeed, some individuals report well-preserved function despite pain of 9/10 in severity, while others portray a vegetative existence with a pain level of 4/10. It is essential to know the extent to which the following functions are impeded by pain: ADL, socialization, recreation, work, sleep, sexuality, and cognition.\n\nA quasi-quantification of functional status can be derived by scoring the extent to which pain interferes with each (applicable) activity. The individual should be queried as to how often he or she leaves the home (with documentation if housebound), gets out only for medical appointments, and the like. \u201cDown time,\u201d the total number of hours a day the person is reclining, is a useful measure.\n\nIt is useful to provide quantification of functional limitations via accepted, standardized instruments that permit interrater comparisons. The Pain Disability Index provides 0 to 10 scales on which individuals rate pain-related interference in seven domains, including family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self-care, and life support activities (eating, sleeping, breathing).25 The SF-36 is widely used to determine the degree of functional impairment and changes in overall wellness following treatment of those with pain as well as of other populations.26 The Oswestry27 and Roland-Morris28 are brief questionnaires that provide an economical office assessment of function in individuals with back pain. A large number of other instruments exist, as reported in the literature. It is also possible to correlate estimates of function to actual impairment using questionnaires and scales.\n\nThe ADL listed in Table 1-2 are commonly classified within one of eight different areas: physical activity, nonspecialized hand activities, sleep, travel, self-care and personal hygiene, sexual function, communication, and sensory function.29 The first six of these are most relevant for impairment due to pain, as it is extremely rare for pain to create major restrictions in communication and sensory functioning. A number of measures have been developed to assess ADL, some of which are general and others of which are designed for use with specific diseases and injuries.30,31 Physicians may choose to select from among the available ADL scales if they wish a more detailed assessment. Although individuals may have difficulty separating the effect of specific diseases or injuries from the pain on their activities, some estimate is necessary to help in determining the extent of impairment due to pain that exceeds activity restriction due to the disease or injury. For example, an individual with a below-the-knee amputation may have some activity limitations in ambulation; he or she may have additional limitations due to severe stump pain.",
  "Section 231 - 3014 chars": "Several well-established general measures have been standardized on chronic pain sufferers and have been used in numerous published studies that may be of particular use as they assess several important domains relevant to the assessment of impairment.\nFor example, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) is a widely used health status measure that has been shown to reliably assess the impact of health problems on function and quality of life.32 The West Haven\u2013Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI)33 is another reliable and valid health status measure that has been used extensively.\n\nDetermine the Presence of Emotional Distress\nAn important component of chronic pain-related impairment is its associated affective distress, which often includes sadness, anger or irritability, and anxiety.34 In some cohorts, the depression seems to be primarily a function of life interference and cognitive changes, while in others it seems to be primarily a function of the pain itself.35 In either case, it is unnecessary that an individual meet diagnostic criteria for a mood, anxiety, or other psychiatric disorder for there to be substantial suffering related to such issues as pain, loss of meaningful and pleasurable life activities, and a bleak future.\n\nIt may be appropriate to use rating scales to provide some quantification of affective changes. Brief selfadministered screens for depression, such as the Beck Depression Inventory,36 the Zung Depression Index,37 and rater-administered screens such as the Hamilton Self-rating Scale for Depression,38 may alert the physician to the presence of a mood disorder that requires treatment, as well as to the possibility of suicide. Similar instruments are available for anxiety and include the Beck Anxiety Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. The Profile of Mood States (POMS),39 which has also been useful in providing quantification of various mood states in individuals with chronic pain, has scales reflecting impaired concentration, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and others.\n\nAs with pain reports, these instruments all are subject to minimization or exaggeration on the part of the individual. People are seen who score four times the cutoff for depression on the Beck Depression Inventory, yet who are animated and playful in the gym. When such discrepancies occur, the weighting given the instrument should be minimal. Moreover, caution must be taken in interpreting responses on these measures, as they were not standardized on samples of individuals with medical disorders, and using the usual cutoff scores may lead to an excessively large number of false positives.\n\nIt is important to obtain information from the individual regarding the impact of pain on his or her mood state. As noted in the discussion of activity restrictions, it may be difficult for the individual to separate the effect of specific diseases or injuries from the pain on activities; however, the items are designed to obtain a rough estimate of the individual\u2019s beliefs.",
  "Section 232 - 3122 chars": "Determine if Pain Behaviors Are Present Pain behaviors are the ways that individuals communicate about their pain. These behaviors may be verbal or nonverbal. The individual may be unaware of them, as they may be emitted and maintained due to responses that have been received from significant others, including health care professionals. In other\ninstances, individuals may exaggerate their behaviors to signal pain and distress with the intent to achieve some desired response from those who observe the behaviors. Thus, both the antecedents and consequences of the behaviors are important.\n\nSome individuals appear stoic as they go through evaluations, and the pain behaviors they do demonstrate are concordant with other medical information regarding their condition. In this instance, the pain behaviors provide valuable clues regarding a person\u2019s diagnosis and tend to validate the fact that he or she is suffering because of the diagnosed condition. For example, consider an individual with suspected degenerative joint disease of the hip who walks with a characteristic limp. The limp provides a clue to the diagnosis and tends to support the individual\u2019s reports that he or she has significant pain when walking.\n\nAt the opposite extreme, an individual may demonstrate pain behaviors that appear exaggerated and discordant with his or her presumed medical condition. These pain behaviors may appear to be driven by a variety of factors, such as overwhelming somatic anxiety or the person\u2019s desire to convince an examiner that he or she is suffering greatly. The common denominator underlying them is that they do not appear to be direct, inevitable consequences of a definable medical condition. Exaggerated, discordant pain behaviors tend to cast doubt on the validity of the information that people provide regarding their condition.\n\nThus, an examiner has a twofold task regarding pain behaviors demonstrated by a person undergoing an impairment rating: to identify the pain behaviors, and to interpret their significance, that is, to decide whether they tend to authenticate the validity of the individual\u2019s suffering or to raise questions about his or her communication style.\n\nIt is hard to specify a generic list of pain behaviors. The behaviors to look for depend on the individual\u2019s medical condition, examination maneuvers that are performed, previous responses obtained, and intent. Physicians probably differ significantly in what they view as exaggerated pain behaviors. Sources of variation include different concepts of what represents \u201clegitimate disease\u201d and thresholds for calling a behavior abnormal.\n\nDespite the limitations noted, pain behaviors provide useful information regarding both the impact of pain on observable behavior and the individual\u2019s style of communicating (eg, demonstrative, stoic) about their pain. The physician should observe the individual\u2019s pain behaviors as he or she enters the examination room, during the interview, and during the history taking. This will eliminate the increase in pain behaviors that might be directly associated with the physical examination.",
  "Section 233 - 3474 chars": "The examiner should give a score between +10 and\n\u201310 to indicate his or her global evaluation of an individual\u2019s pain behavior during the interview and physical examination. A positive score is given when the individual demonstrates pain behaviors that are concordant with the overall clinical findings and, in the opinion of the examiner, tend to authenticate his or her suffering. A negative score is given when an individual demonstrates grossly \u201cnonorganic\u201d or \u201cexaggerated\u201d pain behaviors. A score close to 0 should be given when the examiner is uncertain about how to interpret the individual\u2019s pain behaviors.\n\nThe specific behaviors an examiner considers vary according to the individual\u2019s medical condition and the examination maneuvers performed. Potentially significant behaviors that commonly occur during evaluations are listed in Table 18-5. Note that the significance of pain behavior cannot be determined unless related to a particular individual and context. Thus, a pain behavior that would be considered concordant in one clinical context would be considered discordant in a different one. Also, note that pain behaviors that tend to validate an individual\u2019s pain are generally specific to that person\u2019s medical condition. In contrast, exaggerated pain behaviors\u2014such as emotional displays and pain-limited weakness\u2014 tend to occur in conjunction with a wide variety of medical conditions.\n\nThe physician can record the pain behaviors observed using the behaviors listed in Table 18-5.40 These behaviors may be viewed as indicating symptom magnification, especially when several are present and they grossly exceed what might be expected from individuals with a similar diagnosis. These systematic observations should be used as the basis for determining a global rating regarding the presence and congruence of pain behaviors given the individual\u2019s diagnosis and organ dysfunction.\n\nCredibility of the Individual\nPhysicians routinely assess the credibility of individuals in the course of their clinical work. This kind of assessment is particularly important in the context of rating pain-related impairment because the ratings depend on verbal and nonverbal behaviors of people that are at least partly under voluntary control.\nAlthough there are no definite rules for assessing credibility, Section 18.4, Behavioral Confounders, discusses several issues that a physician should consider when making a judgment about a person\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe key question the examiner should ask is, Do the limitations that an individual describes and demonstrates accurately reflect the burden of illness he or she bears during everyday activity?\n\n\n18.4 Behavioral Confounders\nAn extensive literature demonstrates what common sense suggests: pain behaviors and perception of pain are strongly influenced by beliefs, expectations, rewards, attention, and training. In the absence of a direct measure of pain, such behaviors function as markers by which pain is judged. However, voluminous literature demonstrates that these markers reflect social and environmental factors as much as they reflect pain. It has been shown, for example, that individual ratings of pain severity diminish when \u201cwell talk\u201d is reinforced. With repeated identical pain stimuli, intensity reports vary with feedback. Verbal reinforcement increases performance in individuals with back pain. Studies consistently show that spouse solicitousness is correlated with pain behavior.41",
  "Section 234 - 3038 chars": "Prospective studies consistently show that onset of disabling pain is highly associated with such factors as job dissatisfaction, lack of support at work, stress, and perceived inadequacy of income.42-45 Once initiated, the progression of pain to chronicity is contingent on similar factors.46,47 Financial compensation, receipt of work-related sickness payments, and compensation-related litigation are also associated with chronicity, as are such social and economic factors as poor education, language problems, and low income. Chronicity is also favored by individual tendencies to be preoccupied with one\u2019s body and symptoms.48,49 Even in individuals with clear-cut radicular pain from disk prolapse/protrusion, application for retirement at 6 months was best predicted by depression and daily hassles at work.50,51 In the case of injured workers, performance on functional capacity evaluation is reduced if the worker is informed that the test results will be used to determine work classification.52 Industrial injuries and compensation situations appear to provide a disproportionate number of individuals with such issues.53,54\n\nAlthough the suffering induced by a miserable vocational situation may equal or exceed that from disease or injury, it is the intent of the Guides to assign impairment based on disease and injury, not on such environmental situations as an individual\u2019s fear of returning to a hostile work environment. Similarly, the physician charged with assigning an impairment rating expects to discharge the obligation by assessing the state of the person as an organism, and he or she rightly considers such external factors as the state of the economy, the market for particular skills, and the local tolerance for language barriers to be distracters that lower the \u201csignal-to-noise\u201d ratio in the assessment.\n\nThus, examiners face a dilemma. They know that a variety of nonbiological factors strongly influence the disability status and ADL deficits of individuals they rate, but they are charged with the task of rating impairment on the basis of measurable dysfunctions of organ or body parts.\n\n\n18.4a Assessing Behavioral Reliability\nA primary step in radiographic interpretation is evaluation of the quality of the image. Incorrect exposure, motion artifact, and other technical deficiencies may weaken the conclusions that may be drawn from the image. The principal gauge of pain is its associated behaviors, which include reports. Thus, it is critical that this measure of pain be assessed for reliability. Inappropriate pain behavior, embellishment, and symptom magnification are common, particularly in medicolegal circumstances and entitlement programs. The following is a guide to their assessment.\n\nCongruence With Established Conditions In cases of phantom pain, the individual describes pain in an absent extremity. While this might be expected to evoke incredulity, it does not because this condition has been well described for decades, long before its pathophysiology was understood.",
  "Section 235 - 3182 chars": "Similarly, the person with complex regional pain syndrome (previously called reflex sympathetic dystrophy, or RSD) may describe exquisite pain on light touch of a healthy-appearing extremity following a trivial injury. A constellation of associated signs and symptoms, such as cold sensitivity, autonomic changes, trophic changes, dystonic phenomena, and others help to confirm that the pain complaint is consistent with a known clinical syndrome. Intolerance of light touch over a region of the lower back in individuals with mechanical low back pain is inconsistent with a defined disease process and thus fails to meet this criterion.\n\nMost known conditions have such expected concomitants. Typically, an individual would not watch television or read while waiting for a migraine to abate, and there would be an expected response to ergots, triptans, or other antimigraine preparations. An individual with neuropathic pain will likely, but not always, show some response to certain antiepileptic drugs (eg, gabapentin, carbamazepine) or antidepressants (eg, tricyclics). A person with persistent pain of pancreatitis would be unlikely to gain weight.\n\nConsistency Over Time and Situation\nThere is risk in placing unwarranted confidence in the validity of assessments that are numeric and therefore often considered \u201cobjective\u201d and \u201cscientific.\u201d Such confidence is challenged by such observations as a person who can tolerate only 10\u00b0 forward flexion while standing, yet can sit with legs outstretched and touch his or her toes. Similarly, a person may demonstrate collapsing with pain on manual testing of plantar flexion, yet be able to tiptoe. Others may limp on one leg walking forward, the other walking backward, but neither on a treadmill. Grip strength may\nbe measured repeatedly and coefficients of variation calculated, although these methods have been criticized.55 Rapid exchange grip strength testing may provide similar information.56 Isokinetic strength testing may discriminate between maximal and submaximal effort.57 Complaints and dysfunction should be relatively independent of the observers present and should generally persist, despite distraction.\n\nConsistency With Anatomy and Physiology Waddell\u2019s signs are perhaps the best known of numerous indicators of pain behaviors that are more likely to be accounted for by an individual\u2019s expectations than by organic pathology.58,59 One example is that of axial rotation, in which the standing individual\u2019s hips are rotated in each direction by the examiner. This essentially affects only the hips and ankles, leaving the pelvis and all above it to move as a unit. Exacerbation of back pain by this maneuver is considered abnormal. It is important, however, when using this method not to rate the individual on only one abnormal test and to place the response in the context of the individual\u2019s history and physical examination.\n\nObserver Agreement\nCollateral information from relatives and other evaluating professionals is of critical value in determining the consistency of individual behaviors, which helps to confirm that their relationship is to perceived pain and varies little with changes in observers.",
  "Section 236 - 3019 chars": "Other Inappropriate Illness Behavior\nIt may be difficult to judge whether or not behavior is compatible with perceived pain. For example, because one cannot know how much leg pain an individual experiences on walking, it is hard to know\nwhether an antalgic gait is exaggerated. Inappropriate illness behavior may be suspected, however, if an individual demonstrates dysfunction in unrelated domains. For example, except in extreme situations, an individual with back pain should not require that the spouse complete the individual\u2019s questionnaire\u2014 or his or her sentences. Chronic pain rarely precludes making one\u2019s own phone calls to the doctor, paying bills, etc. When a person has delegated these functions to others, abnormal illness behavior is likely.\n\n\n18.4b Incorporating Behavioral Confounders Into Impairment Ratings Physicians should consider the confounders described in Section 18.4a when they evaluate the pain behaviors of individuals (see Determine if Pain Behaviors Are Present, Section 18.3f) and when they rate the credibility of individuals (see Credibility of the Individual, Section 18.3f).\n\n\n18.4c Cautions\nAlthough no one would conclude that because an\nx-ray is of poor quality there is unlikely to be pathology of concern, this non sequitur frequently occurs in cases of aberrant pain behaviors. Such behaviors should properly cause physicians to be uncertain, but not dismissive. Behavior is affected by many factors. The appearance of symptom exaggeration can be created by fear or by having learned that certain actions or positions provoke pain. \u201cNonphysiologic\u201d signs may occur in dementia. Excessive or exaggerated pain behaviors can be a response to feeling discounted or mistrusted, so that one must emphasize symptoms to persuade physicians of their reality.\nAnyone might dramatize a problem in an effort to have it taken seriously. Thus, symptom magnification can be an iatrogenic phenomenon that occurs when an individual feels mistrusted or poorly cared for.\n\n18.5\nHow to Rate\nPain-Related Impairment: A Sample Protocol\nAs the preceding discussion indicates, a physician must rely on a wide range of clinical skills when he or she assesses pain-related impairment. Also, the discussion indicates that several different assessment instruments may be used in the course of the assessments. The plethora of assessment methods available can further complicate the already difficult task facing the examining physician.\n\nThe protocol described below selects assessment instruments and procedures that, in the opinion of the authors, permit physicians to reach conclusions about pain-related impairment that are reliable and valid.\nThe specific steps in the protocol are as follows:\n\n\n1. Determine whether the individual is medically stable.\n\n2. Follow the steps outlined in Figure 18-1.\n\n3. If a formal assessment of pain-related impairment is to be performed:\na. Have the individual complete the questionnaire shown in Table 18-4.",
  "Section 237 - 3624 chars": "(1) This provides information about three domains that are relevant to pain-related impairment: severity of pain, ADL restrictions, and emotional distress.\n(2) Follow the instructions given in Table 18-6 to obtain the person\u2019s score for each of these three domains.\nb. Observe the individual\u2019s pain behaviors throughout the evaluation. Follow the instructions given in Table 18-5 to obtain the individual\u2019s score for the pain behaviors domain.\nc. Make a global assessment of the person\u2019s credibility, taking into consideration the factors discussed in the Section 18.4. Assign a score between \u201310 and +10, where \u201310 indicates very low credibility and +10 indicates very high credibility. Enter this score in line 5 of Table\n\n18-6. If the credibility score is less than 0, the examiner should consider the possibility of aborting the pain-related impairment assessment on the grounds that the individual does not meet the entry criteria given in Section 18.3b.\n\nd. Follow the instructions given in Table 18-6 to combine scores from each of the above five domains (severity of pain, ADL restrictions, emotional distress, pain behaviors, and credibility) into a total pain-related impairment score. These scores are not impairment ratings but are used only to classify the individual as discussed under c.\ne. Follow the instructions given in Table 18-7 to convert this total pain-related impairment score into one of the four categories of impairment described in Table 18-3 (ie, mild, moderate, moderately severe, or severe).\n\n4. Review the material provided in Sections 18.3a and 18.3b to determine whether the pain-related impairment is ratable or unratable.\n\n5. The final impairment rating should include the following:\na. The percentage impairment rating based on the dysfunction in the organ or body part being rated (see step A in Section 18.3d).\nb. Additional impairment of up to 3% may be given if an individual has pain-related impairment that increases the burden of illness slightly (see step C in Section 18.3d).\nc. If the individual has undergone a formal painrelated assessment:\n(1) An indication of the individual\u2019s painrelated impairment category (see 3e above).\n(2) An indication of whether this impairment is ratable or unratable.\n(a) If pain-related impairment is ratable, an indication of whether or not the painrelated impairment is adequately encapsulated by the impairment rating given for organ or body part dysfunction (see Section 18.3a).\n\n\n18.6  Psychogenic Pain\nSomatoform disorders are a group of conditions characterized by physical symptoms that are not fully explained by a medical condition, the effects of a substance, or another mental disorder.60 The symptoms are not under voluntary control. Pain disorder is diagnosed when pain is a predominant focus of the presentation and causes significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.\nPsychological factors are judged to play a significant role in the onset, severity, exacerbation, or maintenance of the pain. Pain disorder associated with psychological factors is diagnosed when psychological factors are judged to have the major role; in this subtype, general medical conditions play little or no role. Pain disorder associated with both psychological factors and a general medical condition is indicated when both psychological factors and a general medical condition are judged to have important roles in the onset, severity, exacerbation, or maintenance of the pain. The diagnoses are rather general, and almost any person with persistent pain would meet the inclusion criteria.",
  "Section 238 - 3135 chars": "These current diagnostic terms appear to refer to conditions previously called conversion, hysteria, and psychogenic pain. There appears to be no fully satisfactory explanation or conceptualization of these conditions. Since pain is a perceptual experience, one could argue that all pain is a psychic phenomenon. Thus, psychogenic pain would be a tautology, much like psychogenic joy. Certainly, those processes in the dorsal horn, spinothalamic tract, and thalamus of an anesthetized person are not considered pain, a term reserved for what occurs when these processes access conscious awareness in an aversive fashion.\n\nThe concept of psychogenic pain is further complicated by the fact that a variety of conditions formerly considered psychogenic have been found to be neurologically based and that its diagnostic signs have been challenged.61 Nevertheless, psychogenic pain appears to exist and probably represents several different phenomena. Unlike psychogenic pain, other psychogenic symptoms can be confirmed; for example, conversion blindness preserves the opticokinetic reflex, psychogenic seizures occur during a normal EEG recording, conversion anesthesia does not diminish the sensory evoked potential, and psychogenically paralyzed extremities move during sleep. Such confirmation is unavailable in the case of pain.\n\nSome individuals are seen whose symptoms resemble no organic condition, who have inconsistent and nonphysiologic physical findings, yet who demonstrate great distress with agitation or psychomotor retardation, inability to sleep, and a general misery that is consistent across environments and confirmed by others. Such individuals\u2019 suffering is genuine, should not be minimized, and constitutes a risk for suicide. It is most probable that these individuals truly perceive pain, suffer with it, and are impaired.\n\nChapter 14, which deals with impairment associated with mental disorders, describes a system for assessing impairment among individuals with pain disorders. Examiners will sometimes be uncertain about whether to use the assessment procedures described in this chapter or the ones described in Chapter 14. They should ask the following key question when evaluating an individual whose chronic pain is not fully explained on the basis of organ pathology: Does it appear that psychological factors played a major role in the initiation of the pain syndrome or are playing a major role in its continuation? If the answer to this question is yes, the examiner should use the rating methods described in Chapter 14. If the answer is no, or if the examiner is uncertain, he or she should use the rating methods described in this chapter.\n\n\n18.7  Malingering\nMalingering is conscious deception for the purpose of gain. While most authorities declare that malingering is quite uncommon, there appear to be few data regarding its frequency. Fishbain et al reviewed literature suggesting that malingering is present in 1.25% to 10.4% of individuals with chronic pain; however, they found serious flaws with the methodology and concluded that no conclusions could be drawn from the data.62",
  "Section 239 - 3040 chars": "Other fields provide some limits regarding the prevalence of malingering. In individuals with unexplained intractable diarrhea, 14% had positive stool examinations for laxatives, although all had denied use of laxatives.63 Among 333 people who claimed compensation for noise-induced hearing loss, the incidence of exaggeration on hearing tests (as determined by cortical evoked response audiometry) was 17.7%.64 Weintraub cites studies showing that 20% to 46% of people consider purposeful misrepresentation of compensation claims to be acceptable behavior.65\n\nThese studies suggest that factitious illness and malingering may not be rare, but they do not provide information as to how often these conditions simulate pain. They do suggest that evaluators keep an open mind as to the possibility of these phenomena, which are probably less likely in those seeking treatment than in those seeking compensation.\n\nConfirmation of malingering is extremely difficult and generally depends on intentional or inadvertent surveillance. Anecdotes abound of providers running into wheelchair-bound individuals strolling about a mall or encountering an individual in the parking lot holding a cane in the air and demonstrating a normal gait. By definition, malingering is not a disease but a volitional deception. It thus requires no treatment.\n\n\n18.9 Case Examples\n\n\n18.8  Conclusion\nThe assessment of pain-related impairment constitutes a substantial challenge, as it is the most common reason for disability, the most subjective, and perhaps the most multifaceted. Equitable quantification of impairment requires attention to subjective experiences of pain and emotional distress, as well as reports of behavioral impairment, all of which can only be confirmed indirectly. At times, it seems to present the dilemma of being too difficult to perform and too essential to omit.\n\nDespite these obstacles, it appears that each of the components of pain can, in most cases, be assessed with good reliability if a meticulous evaluation is performed that includes observation and collateral information. In this way, the interests of individuals who hope to achieve validation of their symptoms and payers who hope to avoid indiscriminate financial obligations can be fairly addressed.\n\nManual End Chapter 18 (last Chapter)\n\nAppendix\n\nRecording Range-of-Motion Measurements\n\nRange-of-motion (ROM) measurements are used in the spine, upper extremities, and lower extremities to identify dysfunction in movement that may result in changes in function in the body part. Physicians have questioned the reproducibility of ROM measurements, as well as their ability to predict aspects of function.1 Reproducibility may be improved with the use of standardized measurement techniques, proper equipment, trained evaluators, adequate designated warm-up exercises, and uniform recording.1,2 The purpose of this appendix is to provide further information on factors that can affect reproducibility to lead to greater standardization in technique.",
  "Section 240 - 3416 chars": "Measurement Devices\nThe Guides refers to the use of goniometers or inclinomers to measure joint motion. Except in the spine, in which the inclinometer is the device of choice, either the inclinometer or the goniometer can be used to reliably measure joint motion, depending on the preference and experience of the examiner. A twoarm goniometer depends on visual assessment of both the stationary and the moving arm. An inclinometer measures gravity and enables the starting position to be consistently recorded with respect to gravity. Some researchers and clinicians believe the inclinometer is easier to use and more accurate, although limited data exist supporting this opinion.3 Other electronic devices may also yield accurate measurements. Limited data exist concerning how measurements from newer devices compare to the more commonly used goniometers and inclinometers. Before using another measurement device, the evaluator should assess its reproducibility and accuracy compared to established tools and methods.\n\nMeasurement Techniques\nTo increase accuracy, identify anatomic landmarks, properly position and stabilize the body, and use a consistent technique as outlined in the Guides to apply the measuring device to the joint. Anatomic landmarks are listed in the Guides. It is recommended that the evaluator mark these areas with tape or a marking pencil to ensure the same starting position for repeated measurements. The evaluator should also record the landmarks used in the impairment report; differences in the site of the landmark could result in different findings among examiners.\n\nPrior to obtaining measurements, have the individual perform appropriate warm-up exercises to obtain an accurate assessment of current ability. Include repetitions of extension, flexion, lateral bending, and rotation as listed in the relevant chapters.\n\nProperly position and stabilize the area, taking into account the individual\u2019s impairment, level of comfort, and known biomechanical characteristics of the joint.1 Most optimal positions for measurement are noted in the Guides. Obtain proper body alignment and stabilization of the device before recording measurements. Active movements are recommended since they may be more consistent than passive movements, less of a risk to individual injury, and a better approximation of the individual\u2019s function.\nFigure A-1a Neutral (0\u00b0) Starting Positions for ROM Measurements\u2014Frontal Plane\nDifferences in recording systems for ROM measurements can contribute to additional errors in interpretation. Ideally, the examiner records the starting point and measurements in reference to the starting point. Subsequent motions are recorded in a reproducible and succinct manner.\n\nROM measurements can be recorded with text descriptions or with the use of a numeric format. A numeric format has been adopted by some states and a few countries in Europe to facilitate an efficient and uniform way of recording and retrieving data.\nThis numeric format is known as the SFTR method of recording joint motion. The SFTR method allows recording of motion with only one letter and a maximum of three numbers. This numeric format is brief and complete, minimizes errors in transcription or understanding, and facilitates communication with the universal language of numbers. The SFTR format also enables easy translation of data from reports to computerized formats and displays.",
  "Section 241 - 3022 chars": "Several requirements need to be met to use and record measurements according to the SFTR method.\n\n1. All joint measurements are measured from a defined, neutral 0\u00b0 starting position, as shown in Figure A-1a. This neutral starting position is the generally accepted anatomic position, with the body upright and the upper extremities extended at the side of the body with palms facing anteriorly. If the individual is sitting, supine, or prone, the starting position relates to the upright anatomic position. The starting position for rotation is midway between external and internal rotation or supination and pronation.\n2. All joint motion is recorded in three basic planes: sagittal (S), frontal (F), and transverse (T). Rotation (R) crosses multiple planes and receives a separate recording. The planes are depicted in Figure 15-7.\na. The sagittal (S) plane divides the body into right and left halves. (S) motions include extension and flexion.\n\nb. The frontal (F) plane divides the body into anterior and posterior parts (front and back).\n(F) motions include abduction, adduction, elevation, depression, radial and ulnar deviation, and lateral bending of the spine to the left\nand right.\nc. The transverse (T) plane divides the body into upper and lower halves. (T) motions include horizontal shoulder extension and flexion, hip horizontal abduction and adduction (hip flexed at 90\u00b0), shoulder retraction and protraction, and hallux valgus.\nd. Rotation (R) can occur in any of the planes, depending on the limb positions. (R) motions include external and internal rotation, supination and pronation, and spine rotation to the left and right.\n3. Record all motions with three numbers in a specific sequence. Record movements to the left or away from the middle of the body first: extension, abduction, external rotation, supination, valgus, eversion, lateral bending, or rotation of the spine to the left. Then record the reference (starting) position, which is normally 0\u00b0, in the middle. Record movements toward the middle of the body after the reference 0\u00b0 (on the right side of 0\u00b0): flexion, adduction, internal rotation, pronation, varus, inversion, lateral bending, or rotation of the spine to the right.\n4.\nRecord all positions of ankylosis with two numbers, indicating the degree of ankylosis and the reference or starting position of 0\u00b0. For example, wrist ankylosis in 20\u00b0 of extension is recorded as: wrist (S): 20-0 and in 20\u00b0 of flexion as wrist (S) 0-20.\n5. When the neutral 0\u00b0 position cannot be reached due to limited or restricted motion, the middle number will not be 0 but will be the actual starting position. For example, an elbow flexed at 30\u00b0 (extension lag of 30\u00b0), with further flexion to 90\u00b0, is recorded as S: 0-30-90.\n\nTables A-1, A-2, and A-3 describe a method to record ROM measurements for the upper extremties, lower extremities, and spine, using a standard text description and a numeric recording system, the SFTR method.\n\u2020 A non-0\u00b0 starting position is noted in the ankylosis table."
