Hypertension is the most common risk factor for CHF and contributes to a large proportion of heart fail- ure cases in this population-based sample.

Evaluates 48 patients with chronic obstructive pul- monary disease by means of pulmonary-function and exercise testing to determine whether any tests of pulmonary function could predict development of arte- rial desaturation during exercise. Only two indexes— diffusing capacity and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)—were predictive of desaturation.
24. Gallagher CG. Exercise limitation and clinical exercise testing in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Clin Chest Med. 1994;15:305-326.
Clinical exercise testing is an important tool in assess- ment of exercise limitation in COPD patients, in assess- ment of physiologic and psychological factors that contribute to exercise limitation, and in the differential diagnosis of cardiorespiratory disease. Further studies that examine the clinical utility of exercise testing are needed because there are currently insufficient data regarding the utility of many exercise variables.

Measurements of urethral pressures, such as maximum urethral pressure, are widely believed to have relevance in the management of urinary incontinence despite evidence to the contrary. In this study, maximum urethral pressure and the abdominal pressure required to cause stress incontinence were measured in 125 women with stress incontinence. In women, the
abdominal pressure required to cause stress incontinence was unrelated to maximum urethral pressure.

A total of 140 patients underwent penile vascular evalua- tion with intracavernous papaverine injection combined with duplex ultrasonography. Of these patients, eight were potent men who were evaluated for reasons other than erectile failure. These potent men were used as controls to obtain normal values. The remaining 132 patients had erectile impotence of various etiologies.

Stereopsis

McKee S, Levi D, Bowne S. The importance of stereopsis.
Vision Res. 1990;30:1763-1779
Describes a series of very scientific tests to measure the accuracy of stereopsis. The authors conclude that stereopsis can be very good in judging small differences in the plane of fixation, but that it is many times worse than monocular cues in judging depth differences beyond the plane of fixation and is also time-consuming. Stereopsis is most useful to guide fine hand movements.

Sheedy J, Bailey I, Buri M, Bass E. Binocular vs monocular task performance. Am J Optom Physiol Opt. 1986;63:839- 846.
In this study, subjects were timed as they performed various tasks monocularly and binocularly. The findings confirm the fact that stereopsis is useful for fine hand coordination but not for tasks at greater distances.
