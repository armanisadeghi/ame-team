  "The Guides was first published in book form in 1971 in response to a public need for a standardized, objective approach to evaluating medical impair- ments. Sections of the first edition of the Guides were originally published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, beginning in 1958 and continuing until August 1970.1 Since then, the Guides has undergone four revisions, culminating in the current, fifth edition. The purpose of this fifth edition of the Guides is to update the diagnostic cri- teria and evaluation process used in impairment assessment, incorporating available scientific evi- dence and prevailing medical opinion. Chapter authors were encouraged to use the latest scientific evidence from their specialty and, where evidence was lacking, develop a consensus view. This chapter was revised from the earlier edition in response to specific requests from user groups concerning the definitions, appropriate use, and scope of application of the Guides.",

  "The fifth edition includes most of the common con- ditions, excluding unusual cases that require individ- ual consideration. Since this edition encompasses the most current criteria and procedures for impairment assessment, it is strongly recommended that physi- cians use this latest edition, the fifth edition, when rating impairment.",

  "1.2 Impairment, Disability, and",
  "\tHandicap",
  "1.2a Impairment",
  "The Guides continues to define impairment as",
  "\u201ca loss, loss of use, or derangement of any body part, organ system, or organ function.\u201d 2 This defi- nition of impairment is retained in this edition. A medical impairment can develop from an illness or injury. An impairment is considered permanent when it has reached maximal medical improvement (MMI), meaning it is well stabilized and unlikely to change substantially in the next year with or without medical treatment. The term impairment in the Guides refers to permanent impairment, which is the focus of the Guides.",
  "",
  "An impairment can be manifested objectively, for example, by a fracture, and/or subjectively, through fatigue and pain.3 Although the Guides emphasizes objective assessment, subjective symptoms are included within the diagnostic criteria. According to the Guides, determining whether an injury or illness results in a permanent impairment requires a medical assessment performed by a physician. An impair- ment may lead to functional limitations or the inabil- ity to perform activities of daily living.",
  "",
  "Table 1-1, adapted from a report by the AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, lists various definitions of impairment and disability used by four main authorities: the AMA Guides, the World Health Organization, the Social Security Administration, and a state workers\u2019 compensation statute.4 Although a nationally accepted definition for impairment does not exist, the general concept of impairment is simi- lar in the definitions of most organizations. Several terms used in the AMA definition, and their applica- tion throughout the Guides, will be discussed in this chapter and Chapter 2.",
  "",
  "Loss, loss of use, or derangement implies a change from a normal or \u201cpreexisting\u201d state. Normal is a range or zone representing healthy functioning and varies with age, gender, and other factors such as environmental conditions. For example, normal heart rate varies between a child and adult and according to whether the person is at rest or exercising.",
  "Multiple factors need to be considered when assess- ing whether a specific or overall function is normal. A normal value can be defined from an individual or population perspective.",
  "",
  "When evaluating an individual, a physician has two options: consider the individual\u2019s healthy preinjury or preillness state or the condition of the unaffected side as \u201cnormal\u201d for the individual if this is known, or compare that individual to a normal value defined by population averages of healthy people. The Guides uses both approaches. Accepted population values for conditions such as extremity range-of- motion or lung function are listed in the Guides; it is recommended that the physician use those values as detailed in the Guides when applicable. In other cir- cumstances, for instance, where population values are not available, the physician should use clinical judgment regarding normal structure and function and estimate what is normal for the individual based on the physician\u2019s knowledge or estimate of the indi- vidual\u2019s preinjury or preillness condition.",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "4\tGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "Data from healthy populations, when available and widely referenced, are incorporated into chapters of the Guides. In some organ or body systems, such as respiratory, certain measurements of lung function have been standardized for age and gender. In other body systems, such as the musculoskeletal, age and gender differences are not reflected in most of the values. While there may be age and gender differ- ences anticipated for some musculoskeletal values, such as range of motion in the spine and extremities, this edition of the Guides mainly reflects average range of motion from healthy populations of mixed age and gender. The normal values presented in the musculoskeletal section are based on a review of studies measuring range of motion, as cited in the text. Evaluating physicians may use their clinical judgment, however, and comment on any significant age or gender effect for a particular individual. For instance, the \u201cnormal\u201d preinjury range of motion for a gymnast with hypermobility may exceed the listed normal values.",
  "",
  "If an individual had previous measurements of func- tion that were below or above average population values, the physician may discuss that prior value and any subsequent loss for the individual, as well as compare it to the population normal. For example, a highly functioning athlete with documented, above- normal lung function, who has sustained an injury and now has decreased lung function that is nonethe- less similar to population averages, has experienced a loss in his or her lung function and has sustained an impairment. Based only on a population comparison, the athlete would be given a 0% impairment rating. However, it would be more appropriate in this instance for the physician to assign an impairment rating based on the degree of change from the ath- lete\u2019s preinjury to postinjury state.",
  "",
  "In evaluating impairment, the Guides considers both anatomic and functional loss. Some chapters place a greater emphasis on either anatomic or functional loss, depending upon common practice in that spe- cialty. Anatomic loss refers to damage to the organ system or body structure, while functional loss refers to a change in function for the organ or body system. An example of an anatomic deviation is development of heart enlargement; functional loss includes a loss in ejection fraction or the ability of the heart to pump adequately. Anatomic loss receives greater emphasis in the musculoskeletal system, as in measurements such as range of motion. Functional considerations receive greater emphasis in the mental and behav- ioral section.",
  "",
  "The impairment criteria outlined in the Guides pro- vide a standardized method for physicians to use to determine medical impairment. The impairment cri- teria include diagnostic criteria, incorporating anatomic and functional measures. The impairment criteria were developed from scientific evidence as cited and from consensus of chapter authors or of medical specialty societies.",
  "",
  "Impairment percentages or ratings developed by medical specialists are consensus-derived estimates that reflect the severity of the medical condition and the degree to which the impairment decreases an individual\u2019s ability to perform common activities of daily living (ADL), excluding work. Impairment rat- ings were designed to reflect functional limitations and not disability. The whole person impairment percentages listed in the Guides estimate the impact of the impairment on the individual\u2019s overall ability to perform activities of daily living, excluding work, as listed in Table 1-2.",
  "",
  "",
  "The medical judgment used to determine the original impairment percentages could not account for the diversity or complexity of work but could account for daily activities common to most people. Work is not included in the clinical judgment for impairment percentages for several reasons: (1) work involves many simple and complex activities; (2) work is highly individualized, making generalizations inac- curate; (3) impairment percentages are unchanged for stable conditions, but work and occupations change; and (4) impairments interact with such other factors as the worker\u2019s age, education, and prior work experience to determine the extent of work dis- ability. For example, an individual who receives a 30% whole person impairment due to pericardial heart disease is considered from a clinical standpoint to have a 30% reduction in general functioning as represented by a decrease in the ability to perform activities of daily living. For individuals who work in sedentary jobs, there may be no decline in their work ability although their overall functioning is decreased. Thus, a 30% impairment rating does not correspond to a 30% reduction in work capability.",
  "Similarly, a manual laborer with this 30% impair- ment rating due to pericardial disease may be com- pletely unable to do his or her regular job and, thus, may have a 100% work disability.",
  "",
  "As a result, impairment ratings are not intended for use as direct determinants of work disability. When a physician is asked to evaluate work-related disability, it is appropriate for a physician knowledgeable about the work activities of the patient to discuss the spe- cific activities the worker can and cannot do, given the permanent impairment.",
  "",
  "Most impairment percentages in this fifth edition have been retained from the fourth edition because there are limited scientific data to support specific changes. It is recognized that there are limited data to support some of the previous impairment percent- ages as well. However, these ratings are currently accepted and should not be changed arbitrarily. In this edition, some percentages have been changed for greater scientific accuracy or to achieve consistency throughout the book.",
  "",
  "A 0% whole person (WP) impairment rating is assigned to an individual with an impairment if the impairment has no significant organ or body system functional consequences and does not limit the per- formance of the common activities of daily living",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "indicated in Table 1-2. A 90% to 100% WP impair- ment indicates a very severe organ or body system impairment requiring the individual to be fully dependent on others for self-care, approaching death.",
  "",
  "The activities of daily living, as originally developed for the Guides in the first and second editions,1,6 sig- nify common activities currently represented in scales of Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living.7 The Guides refers to common ADLs, as listed in Table 1-2. The ADLs listed in this table correspond to the activities that physicians should consider when establishing a per- manent impairment rating. A physician can often assess a person\u2019s ability to perform ADLs based on knowledge of the patient\u2019s medical condition and clinical judgment. When the physician is estimating a permanent impairment rating, Table 1-2 can help to determine how significantly the impairment impacts these activities. Using the impairment criteria within a class and knowing the activities the individual can perform, the physician can estimate where the indi- vidual stands within that class.",
  "",
  "There are many scales that measure ability to perform ADLs with greater degrees of accuracy. Many of these scales are concerned with more severe levels of disability, relevant to institutionalized patients and the elderly.7 During the 1970s, the ADL concept was extended to consider problems experienced by those living in the community, a field that has come to be termed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL).7 There is a continued effort to validate these scales; some of the more commonly utilized, vali- dated IADL and ADL scales are listed in Table 1-3.7 Scales vary in their appropriateness for a given indi- vidual, based upon the level of impairment, body sys- tems affected, and degree of accuracy required. Some scales are most appropriate for an active, working population; others are more suited to a chronically ill, disabled population. Since there is no agreed-upon scale for a working population and physicians who use the Guides may evaluate different populations of individuals (ie, healthy or chronically ill), a physician may choose the most appropriate of any of the vali- dated scales for a more in-depth assessment of ADL, to obtain further information to supplement clinical judgment, or to gain assistance in determining where an individual stands within an impairment range.",

  "1.2b Disability",
  "The term disability has historically referred to a broad category of individuals with diverse limitations in the ability to meet social or occupational demands. However, it is more accurate to refer to the specific activity or role the \u201cdisabled\u201d individual is unable to perform. Several organizations are moving away from the term disability and instead are referring to specific activity limitations to encourage an emphasis on the specific activities the individual can perform and to identify how the environment can be altered",
  "to enable the individual to perform the activities associated with various social or occupational roles. (Table 1-1).4",
  "",
  "According to a 1997 Institute of Medicine Report, \u201cdisability is a relational outcome, reflecting the individual\u2019s capacity to perform a specific task or activity, contingent on the environmental conditions in which they are to be performed.\u201d16 Disability is context-specific, not inherent in the individual, but a function of the interaction of the individual and the environment.",
  "",
  "The World Health Organization (WHO) is revising its 1980 International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps and has released a draft document, The International Classification of Impairments, Activities and Participation (ICIDH-2).17 The term disability has been replaced by a neutral term, activity, and limits in ability are described as activity limitations. The change in terminology arose for several reasons: to choose terminology without an associated stigma, to avoid labeling, and to emphasize the person\u2019s residual ability. Representatives world- wide are reviewing this international classification scale of impairments, function, and activities.",
  "",
  "The Guides continues to define disability as an alteration of an individual\u2019s capacity to meet per- sonal, social, or occupational demands or statu- tory or regulatory requirements because of an impairment.2 An individual can have a disability in performing a specific work activity but not have a disability in any other social role.2 Physicians have the education and training to evaluate a person\u2019s health status and determine the presence or absence of an impairment. If the physician has the expertise and is well acquainted with the individual\u2019s activities and needs, the physician may also express an opinion about the presence or absence of a specific disability. For example, an occupational medicine physician who understands the job requirements in a particular workplace can provide insights on how the impair- ment could contribute to a workplace disability.",
  "",
  "The impairment evaluation, however, is only one aspect of disability determination. A disability deter- mination also includes information about the individ- ual\u2019s skills, education, job history, adaptability, age, and environment requirements and modifications.3 Assessing these factors can provide a more realistic picture of the effects of the impairment on the ability to perform complex work and social activities. If adaptations can be made to the environment, the individual may not be disabled from performing that activity.",

  "As discussed in this chapter and illustrated in Figure 1-1, medical impairments are not related to disability in a linear fashion. An individual with a medical impairment can have no disability for some occupa- tions, yet be very disabled for others. For example, severe degenerative disk disease may impair the functioning of the spine of both a licensed practical nurse and a bank president in a similar fashion when performing their activities of daily living. However, in terms of occupation, the bank president is less likely to be disabled by this impairment than the licensed practical nurse. An individual who develops rheumatoid arthritis may be disabled from work as a tailor but may be able to work as a child care aide. A pilot who develops a visual impairment, correctable with glasses, may be able to perform all of his daily activities but is no longer able to fly a commercial plane. An individual with repeated hernias and repairs may no longer be able to lift more than",
  "20 kg (40 lb) but could work in a factory where mechanical lifts are available.",
  "",
  "The Guides is not intended to be used for direct estimates of work disability. Impairment percentages derived according to the Guides criteria do not measure work disability. Therefore, it is inappropri- ate to use the Guides\u2019 criteria or ratings to make direct estimates of work disability.",

  "1.3 The Organ System and Whole Body Approach to",
  "\tImpairment",
  "The Guides impairment ratings reflect the severity and limitations of the organ/body system impairment and resulting functional limitations. Most organ/body systems chapters in the Guides provide impairment ratings that represent the extent of whole person impairment. In addition to listing whole per- son impairments, the musculoskeletal chapters pro- vide regional impairment ratings (eg, upper extremity, lower extremity); regional ratings are then converted into whole person impairment ratings. Within some musculoskeletal regions, a consensus group devel- oped weights to reflect the relative importance of certain regions. For example, different fingers or dif- ferent areas of the spine are given different weights, representing their unique and relative importance to the region\u2019s overall functioning. These weights, which have gained acceptance in clinical practice, have been retained to enable regulatory authorities to convert from a regional body to whole person impair- ment when needed.",
  "",
  "",
  "1.4 Philosophy and Use of the Combined",
  "\tValues Chart",
  "The Combined Values Chart (p. 604) was designed to enable the physician to account for the effects of multiple impairments with a summary value. A stan- dard formula was used to ensure that regardless of the number of impairments, the summary value would not exceed 100% of the whole person.",
  "According to the formula listed in the combined val- ues chart, multiple impairments are combined so that the whole person impairment value is equal to or less than the sum of all the individual impairment values.",
  "",
  "10\tGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "A scientific formula has not been established to indi- cate the best way to combine multiple impairments. Given the diversity of impairments and great vari- ability inherent in combining multiple impairments, it is difficult to establish a formula that accounts for all situations. A combination of some impairments could decrease overall functioning more than sug- gested by just adding the impairment ratings for the separate impairments (eg, blindness and inability to use both hands). When other multiple impairments are combined, a less than additive approach may be more appropriate. States also use different tech- niques when combining impairments. Many work- ers\u2019 compensation statutes contain provisions that combine impairments to produce a summary rating that is more than additive. Other options are to com- bine (add, subtract, or multiply) multiple impair- ments based upon the extent to which they affect an individual\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily liv- ing. The current edition has retained the same com- bined values chart, since it has become the standard of practice in many jurisdictions. Other approaches, when published in scientific peer-reviewed literature, will be evaluated for future editions.",
  "",
  "In general, impairment ratings within the same region are combined before combining the regional impairment rating with that from another region. For example, when there are multiple impairments involving abnormal motion, neurologic loss, and amputation of an extremity part, these impairments first should be combined for a regional extremity impairment. The regional extremity impairment then is combined with an impairment from another region, such as from the respiratory system. Spinal impairments in multiple regions are combined.",
  "Exceptions, as detailed in the musculoskeletal chap- ter, include impairments of the joints of the thumb, which are added, as are the ankle and subtalar joints in the lower extremity: both situations include com- plex motions.",
  "1.5",
  "Incorporating Science with Clinical",
  "\tJudgment",
  "The Guides uses objective and scientifically based data when available and references these sources. When objective data have not been identified, esti- mates of the degree of impairment are used, based on clinical experience and consensus. Subjective con- cerns, including fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, and pain, when not accompanied by demonstrable clinical signs or other independent, measurable abnormalities, are generally not given separate impairment ratings. Chronic pain is discussed in Chapter 18. Physicians recognize the local and dis- tant pain that commonly accompanies many disor- ders. Impairment ratings in the Guides already have accounted for commonly associated pain, including that which may be experienced in areas distant to the specific site of pathology. For example, when a cer- vical spine disorder produces radiating pain down the arm, the arm pain, which is commonly seen,",
  "has been accounted for in the cervical spine impair- ment rating.",
  "",
  "The Guides does not deny the existence or impor- tance of these subjective complaints to the individual or their functional impact. The Guides recommends that the physician ascertain and document subjective concerns. Because the presence and severity of sub- jective concerns varies among individuals with the same condition, the Guides has not yet identified an accepted method within the scientific literature to ascertain how these concerns consistently affect organ or body system functioning. The physician is encouraged to discuss these concerns and symptoms in the impairment evaluation.",
  "",
  "Research is limited on the reproducibility and validity of the Guides.18-20 Anecdotal reports indicate that adoption of the Guides results in a more stan- dardized impairment assessment process. As relevant research becomes available, subsequent editions of the Guides will incorporate these evidence-based studies to improve the Guides\u2019 reliability and validity.",

  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "Given the range, evolution, and discovery of new medical conditions, the Guides cannot provide an impairment rating for all impairments. Also, since some medical syndromes are poorly understood and are manifested only by subjective symptoms, impair- ment ratings are not provided for those conditions.",
  "The Guides nonetheless provides a framework for evaluating new or complex conditions. Most adult conditions with measurable impairments can be eval- uated under the Guides. In situations where impair- ment ratings are not provided, the Guides suggests that physicians use clinical judgment, comparing measurable impairment resulting from the unlisted condition to measurable impairment resulting from similar conditions with similar impairment of func- tion in performing activities of daily living.",
  "",
  "The physician\u2019s judgment, based upon experience, training, skill, thoroughness in clinical evaluation, and ability to apply the Guides criteria as intended, will enable an appropriate and reproducible assess- ment to be made of clinical impairment. Clinical judgment, combining both the \u201cart\u201d and \u201cscience\u201d of medicine, constitutes the essence of medical practice.",

  "1.6 Causation, Apportionment Analysis, and Aggravation",
  "",
  "1.6a Causation",
  "Physicians may be asked to provide an opinion about the likelihood that a particular factor (injury, illness, or preexisiting condition) caused the permanent impairment. Determining causation is important from a legal perspective, as it is a factor in determin- ing liability.",
  "",
  "The term causation has multiple meanings. Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary lists 12 different types of \u201ccause\u201d including constitutional, exciting, immediate, local, precipitating, predispos- ing, primary, proximate, remote, secondary, specific, and ultimate.21 For purposes of the Guides, causation means an identifiable factor (eg, accident or expo- sure to hazards of a disease) that results in a med- ically identifiable condition.",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "Medical or scientifically based causation requires a detailed analysis of whether the factor could have caused the condition, based upon scientific evidence and, specifically, experienced judgment as to whether the alleged factor in the existing environ- ment did cause the permanent impairment.22 Determining medical causation requires a synthesis of medical judgment with scientific analysis.",
  "",
  "The legal standard for causation in civil litigation and in workers\u2019 compensation adjudication varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.23 The physician needs to be aware of the different interpretations of causation and state the context in which the physi- cian\u2019s opinion is being offered.",
  "1.6 b Apportionment Analysis Apportionment analysis in workers\u2019 compensation represents a distribution or allocation of causation among multiple factors that caused or significantly contributed to the injury or disease and resulting impairment. The factor could be a preexisting injury, illness, or impairment. In some instances, the physi- cian may be asked to apportion or distribute a perma- nent impairment rating between the impact of the current injury and the prior impairment rating. Before determining apportionment, the physician needs to verify that all the following information is true for an individual:",
  "",
  "1. There is documentation of a prior factor.",
  "",
  "2. The current permanent impairment is greater as a result of the prior factor (ie, prior impairment, prior injury, or illness).",
  "",
  "3. There is evidence indicating the prior factor caused or contributed to the impairment, based on a reasonable probability (> 50% likelihood).",
  "",
  "12\tGuides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "The apportionment analysis must consider the nature of the impairment and its possible relationship to each alleged factor, and it must provide an explana- tion of the medical basis for all conclusions and opinions. Most states have their own customized methods for calculating apportionment. Generally, the most recent permanent impairment rating is cal- culated, and then the prior impairment rating is cal- culated and deducted. The remaining impairment rating would be attributed or apportioned to the cur- rent injury or condition.",
  "",
  "A common verbal formulation in the workers\u2019 com- pensation context might state, \u201cin cases of permanent disability less than total, if the degree of disability resulting from an industrial injury or occupational disease is increased or prolonged because of a pre- existing physical impairment, the employer shall be liable only for the additional disability from the injury or occupational disease.\u201d 5",
  "",
  "For example, in apportioning a spine impairment rating in an individual with a history of a spine con- dition, one should calculate the current spine impair- ment. Then calculate the impairment from any preexisting spine problem. The preexisting impair- ment rating is then subtracted from the present impairment rating to account for the effects of the former. This approach requires accurate and compa- rable data for both impairments.23",
  "",
  "",
  "1.6c Aggravation",
  "Aggravation, for the purposes of the Guides, refers to a factor(s) (eg, physical, chemical, biological, or medical condition) that alters the course or progres- sion of the medical impairment. For example, an individual develops low back pain and sciatica asso- ciated with the finding of an L3-L4 herniated disk. Symptoms continue but are intermittent and do not interfere with performing activities of daily living. A few years later, the individual twists his body while lifting a heavy package and develops constant, severe, acute low back pain and sciatica. Imaging studies show no change in the herniated disk com- pared to earlier studies. The lifting is considered to have aggravated a preexisting condition.",

  " Use of the Guides",
  "Because of the scope, depth, standardized approach, and foundation in science and medical consensus, the Guides is used worldwide to estimate adult per- manent impairment. A survey completed in 1999 indicates that in the United States, 40 of 51 jurisdic- tions (50 states and the District of Columbia) use the Guides in workers\u2019 compensation cases because of statute or regulations, or by administrative/legal practice.24",
  "",
  "The Guides is formally accepted through adoptive language in each jurisdiction\u2019s statutes (laws passed by a state legislature or the US Congress), court- made law (case law or precedent), or administrative agency regulation (rules promulgated by administra- tive agencies such as a state workers\u2019 compensation board). It is this statutory, judicial, or regulatory adoptive language that determines which edition of the Guides is mandated in a particular jurisdiction. Some states, such as Oregon and Florida, have devel- oped their own impairment criteria, modeled on the concepts and material in the Guides. The Guides is also extensively used by the federal systems, eg, FECA (Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act). The most recent edition of the Guides is recommended as the latest blend of science and medical consensus.",
  "",
  "Beyond the United States, the Guides is used in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and European countries for different applications, includ- ing workers\u2019 compensation, personal injury, and dis- ability claim management. There is a growing international trend to adopt a standardized, medically accepted approach to impairment assessment such as in the Guides. As previously stated, the Guides is not to be used for direct financial awards nor as the sole measure of disability.

  "\tCompensation",
  "In the United States, workers\u2019 compensation is a",
  "no-fault system for providing cash benefits, medical care, and rehabilitation services to individuals with work-related injuries and diseases. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have workers\u2019 compensation acts. Most acts share similar features, although no two are exactly alike. An employee normally must experience a \u201cpersonal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment\u201d to be eligible for benefits. All states provide benefits for workers with occupational diseases, but that coverage is restricted in many states. The claimant receives pay- ments to compensate for lost wages due to temporary total, temporary partial, permanent total, and perma- nent partial disability. Survivors receive death bene- fits. For each category of benefits, the state prescribes a maximum and minimum weekly benefit. Many states stipulate partial compensation for a par- tial loss, based upon a proportion of the number of weeks\u2019 compensation allowed for total loss of the body part.25 Determining eligibility of benefits and the extent of disability is specified by statute and case law.",
  "",
  "Because schedules usually do not cover all condi- tions arising from injuries, many laws allow or require that, in unlisted cases of permanent disability, the jurisdiction must determine the percentage by which the \u201cwhole man\u201d or \u201cindustrial use\u201d of the employee\u2019s body was impaired. The board, commis- sion, or court also must consider the nature of the injury and the employee\u2019s occupation, experience, training, and age and then award proportional com- pensation. Medical information is essential for the decision process in these cases.",
  "",
  "Physicians who perform impairment and/or disability assessments for workers\u2019 compensation purposes need to identify the state workers\u2019 compensation law that applies to the situation, which is usually the state where the incident occurred. The physician needs to determine which edition of the Guides or other state guidelines are required for these assessments. This information can usually be obtained from the state workers\u2019 compensation board or the state medical society. If the Guides is recommended or required, copies may be ordered through the AMA (see copy- right page) or other vendors.",

  "Unfortunately, there is no validated formula that assigns accurate weights to determine how a medical condition can be combined with other factors, including education, skill, and the like, to calculate the effect of the medical impairment on future employment. Therefore, each commissioner or hear- ing official bases a decision on the assessment of the available medical and nonmedical information. The Guides may help resolve such a situation, but it can- not provide complete and definitive answers. Each administrative or legal system that bases disability ratings on permanent impairment defines its own process of converting impairment ratings into a dis- ability rating that reflects the degree to which the impairment limits the capacity to meet personal, social, occupational, and other demands, or to meet statutory requirements. The Guides is a tool for eval- uation of permanent impairment.26, 27",
  "",
  "Impairment percentages derived from the Guides criteria should not be used as direct estimates of disability. Impairment percentages estimate the extent of the impairment on whole person func- tioning and account for basic activities of daily living, not including work.

  "1.9 Employability",
  "\tDeterminations",
  "Physicians with the appropriate skills, training, and knowledge may address some of the implications of the medical impairment toward work disability and future employment. The physician may be asked whether an impaired individual can return to work in a particular job. The employer can provide a detailed job analysis, with the actual and anticipated essential requirements of the job and a review of the work environment, including potential hazards and the need for personal protective equipment. The physi- cian can then determine whether the individual\u2019s abilities match the job demands. The physician needs to determine that the individual, in performing essen- tial job functions, will not either be endangered or endanger colleagues or the work environment. For example, it would be unsafe for an individual with a new, unstable seizure disorder to operate mechanical equipment. The physician and other responsible per- sons should keep in mind the potential for impair- ment aggravation, as well as the possibility of",

  "ducible assessment of the ability of the individual to safely perform the essential functions of the job.",
  "",
  "More complicated are the cases in which the physi- cian is requested to make a broad judgment regard- ing an individual\u2019s ability to return to any job in his or her field. A decision of this scope usually requires input from medical and nonmedical experts, such as vocational specialists, and the evaluation of both sta- ble and changing factors, such as the person\u2019s educa- tion, skills, and motivation, the state of the job market, and local economic considerations.",

  "Physicians who follow the procedures outlined in the Guides, who review the same information from med- ical and employment records, and who examine the same patient with a stable condition should obtain approximately the same findings.",

  "\tMaritime Workers",
  "State workers\u2019 compensation laws are not the only means by which employees are compensated for injuries or illnesses. In 1908, Congress passed the Federal Employer\u2019 s Liability Act (FELA), which put in place a comprehensive injury compensation sys- tem for railroad workers. FELA provides a modified tort system for injured railroad workers, and it super- sedes state workers\u2019 compensation laws. The Jones Act, passed in 1920, covers compensation for mar- itime workers injured due to a ship owner\u2019s negli- gence. That law provides for the same rights and remedies that were extended through FELA.",
  "",
  "A lawsuit filed under FELA must be based on the railroad\u2019s negligence in providing the employee with a safe workplace. An injured employee must prove that the railroad should have foreseen that a condi- tion or activity might cause the injury or disease. The test determines whether the employer\u2019s negligence played any part in producing the injury. Recoverable amounts include those for necessary medical expenses, pain and suffering, loss of past earnings, and future losses due to diminished earning capacity. An important condition for recovery is that a physi- cian must diagnose the effects of the injury.",
  "",
  "Under FELA, all cases must go before a jury or judge, and there are no limits to the amount awarded. In contrast, the awards under state workers\u2019 compen- sation systems are fixed and limited. Under FELA, the jury decides on the degree of the injured person\u2019s disability. The physician is obligated to obtain a reli- able history, confirm past employment by obtaining records, and collect all available medical information.",

  "1.11 The Physician\u2019s Role Based on the Americans with Disabilities Act",
  "\t(ADA)",
  "Physicians, particularly occupational physicians, are frequently asked questions pertaining to work dis- ability and capacity, in light of increasing attention to compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA is a civil rights law that President Bush signed in 1990.28 It was intended \u201cto provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate to end discrimination against individuals with dis- abilities and bring those individuals into the eco- nomic and social mainstream of American life.\u201d18 Under the ADA, individuals with disabilities are pro- tected against discrimination in such diverse areas as employment, government service entitlement, and access to public accommodations (eg, health care services, lodging).",
  "",
  "The ADA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual; a record of impairment; or being regarded as having an impair- ment (see Table 1-1). A person needs to meet only one of the three criteria in the definition to gain the ADA\u2019s protection against discrimination. The physi- cian\u2019s input often is essential for determining the first two criteria and valuable for determining the third.",

  "",
  "To be deemed \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of ADA pro- tection, an individual generally must have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. A \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d could be any mental, psychological, or physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfig- urement, or anatomical loss that affects one or more of the following body systems: neurologic, special sense organs, musculoskeletal, respiratory (including speech organs), reproductive, cardiovascular, hema- tologic and lymphatic, digestive, genitourinary, skin, and endocrine.29",
  "",
  "Conditions that are temporary or not considered to be severe (eg, normal pregnancy) are not considered impairments under the ADA. Other nonimpairments include features and conditions such as hair or eye color, left-handedness, old age, sexual orientation, exhibitionism, pedophilia, voyeurism, sexual addic- tion, kleptomania, pyromania, compulsive gambling, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairment, smoking, and current illegal drug use or resulting psychoactive disorders.",
  "",
  "On June 23, 1999, in answer to a case seeking refine- ment of the definition of \u201cwho is disabled\u201d under the ADA, the Supreme Court stated that individuals who function normally with aids such as glasses or med- ication could not generally be considered disabled, despite their physical impairments.30",
  "",
  "To have the protection of the ADA, a physical or mental impairment must substantially limit the abil- ity to perform a \u201cmajor life activity.\u201d Major life activities include \u201cbasic activities that the average person in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty,\u201d including caring for oneself, manual tasks, hearing, walking, learning, speaking, breathing, working, and reproduction. Major life activities do not have to occur frequently or be part of daily life.31 Note that the major life activities listed here include work, unlike the Guides\u2019 impairment criteria.",
  "",
  "The person must be presently, or perceived to be (not potentially or hypothetically), substantially limited in order to demonstrate a disability. It is difficult to determine if an impairment \u201csubstantially limits\u201d a major life activity. An impairment\u2019s nature, extent, duration, impact, and effect on the individual are all considerations in assessing the \u201csubstantiality\u201d of the limitations.32",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "For some major life activities, such as work, the physician may provide an opinion on the medical impairment\u2019s limitations. However, as indicated by the recent Supreme Court ruling, how much a limita- tion of a major life activity results in a determination of disability depends on the interaction between the remaining functional abilities and the possible types of accommodation being sought.33",
  "",
  "The third criterion that may establish protection under the ADA is an erroneous perception that the individual is substantially limited in a major life activity or is being discriminated against on the basis of a real or perceived characteristic that does not sub- stantially limit a major life activity.",
  "",
  "It is the physician\u2019s responsibility to determine if the impairment results in functional limitations. The physician is responsible for informing the employer about an individual\u2019s abilities and limitations.

  "The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the philo- sophical assumptions and appropriate use of the Guides. The physician needs to comply with pre- scribed local, state, and federal practices for impair- ment evaluations. Generally, the physician evaluates all available information and provides as comprehen- sive a medical picture of the patient as possible, addressing the components listed in the Report of Medical Evaluation form discussed in Chapter 2.",
  "A complete impairment evaluation provides valuable information beyond an impairment percentage, and it includes a discussion about the person\u2019s abilities and limitations, including the ability to perform common activities as listed in Table 1-2.

Two physicians, following the methods of the Guides to evaluate the same patient, should report similar results and reach similar conclusions. Moreover, if the clinical find- ings are fully described, any knowledgeable observer may check the findings with the Guides criteria.

  "2.1 Defining",
  "Impairment Evaluations",
  "An impairment evaluation is a medical evaluation performed by a physician, using a standard method as outlined in the Guides to determine permanent impairment associated with a medical condition. An impairment evaluation may include a numerical impairment percentage or rating, as defined in the Guides. An impairment evaluation is not the same as an independent medical evaluation (IME), which is performed by an independent medical examiner who evaluates but does not provide care for the indi- vidual. Impairment evaluations may be less compre- hensive than IMEs and may be performed by a treating physician or a nontreating physician, depending upon the state\u2019s requirements and the preferences of the individual, physician, and request- ing party. Examples of an impairment evaluation and components of a comprehensive IME will be dis- cussed later in this chapter.",
  "",
  "",
  "2.2 Who Performs Impairment",
  "\tEvaluations?",
  "Impairment evaluations are performed by a licensed physician. The physician may use information from other sources, such as hearing results obtained from audiometry by a certified technician. However, the physician is responsible for performing a medical evaluation that addresses medical impairment in the body or organ system and related systems. A state may restrict the type of practitioner allowed to per- form an impairment evaluation, and some require additional state certification and other criteria, such as a minimum number of hours of practice, before the physician is approved as an impairment evalua- tor. The physician is encouraged to check with the local workers\u2019 compensation agency, industrial acci- dent board, or industrial commission concerning their prerequisites.",
  "2.3",
  "Examiners\u2019 Roles",
  "\tand Responsibilities",
  "The physician\u2019s role in performing an impairment evaluation is to provide an independent, unbiased assessment of the individual\u2019s medical condition, including its effect on function, and identify abilities and limitations to performing activities of daily liv- ing as listed in Table 1-2. Performing an impairment evaluation requires considerable medical expertise and judgment. Full and complete reporting provides the best opportunity for physicians to explain health status and consequences to patients, other medical professionals, and other interested parties such as claims examiners and attorneys. Thorough documen- tation of medical findings and their impact will also ensure that reporting is fair and consistent and that individuals have the information needed to pursue any benefits to which they are entitled.",
  "",
  "The skills required for impairment evaluation are usually not taught during basic medical training, although some specialties such as occupational med- icine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and orthopedics have emphasized elements of the evalua- tion such as occupational, functional, or anatomical assessment.",
  "",
  "In some cases, physicians may be asked to assess the medical impairment\u2019s impact on the individual\u2019s ability to work. In the latter case, physicians need to understand the essential functions of the occupation and specific job, as well as how the medical condi- tion interacts with the occupational demands. In many cases, the physician may need to obtain addi- tional expertise to define functional abilities and lim- itations, as well as vocational demands.",
  "",
  "As an impairment evaluator, the physician has the responsibility to understand the regulations that per- tain to medical practice in his or her specific area, as in workers\u2019 compensation or personal injury evalua- tions. It is also the responsibility of the physician to provide the necessary medical assessment to the party requesting the evaluation, with the examinee\u2019s consent. The physician needs to ensure that the examinee understands that the evaluation\u2019s purpose is medical assessment, not medical treatment.",
  "However, if new diagnoses are discovered, the physi- cian has a medical obligation to inform the request- ing party and individual about the condition and recommend further medical assessment.",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "2.4 When Are Impairment Ratings",
  "\tPerformed?",
  "An impairment should not be considered permanent until the clinical findings indicate that the medical condition is static and well stabilized, often termed the date of maximal medical improvement (MMI). It is understood that an individual\u2019s condition is dynamic. Maximal medical improvement refers to a date from which further recovery or deterioration is not anticipated, although over time there may be some expected change. Once an impairment has reached MMI, a permanent impairment rating may be performed. The Guides attempts to take into account all relevant considerations in rating the severity and extent of permanent impairment and its effect on the individual\u2019s activities of daily living.",
  "",
  "Impairments often involve more than one body sys- tem or organ system; the same condition may be dis- cussed in more than one chapter. Generally, the organ system where the problems originate or where the dysfunction is greatest is the chapter to be used for evaluating the impairment. Thus, consult the vision chapter for visual problems due to optic nerve dys- function. Refer to the extremity chapters for neuro- logical and musculoskeletal extremity impairment from an injury. However, if the impairment is due to a stroke, the neurology chapter is most appropriate.",
  "Whenever the same impairment is discussed in differ- ent chapters, the Guides tries to use consistent impair- ment ratings across the different organ systems.",
  "",
  "",
  "2.5  Rules for Evaluation",
  "",
  "2.5a Confidentiality",
  "Prior to performing an impairment evaluation, the physician obtains the individual\u2019s consent to share the medical information with other parties that will be reviewing the evaluation. If the evaluating physi- cian is also that person\u2019s treating physician, the physician needs to indicate to the individual which information from his or her medical record will",
  "be shared.",
  "",
  "2.5b Combining Impairment Ratings",
  "To determine whole person impairment, the physi- cian should begin with an estimate of the individual\u2019s most significant (primary) impairment and evaluate other impairments in relation to it. It may be neces- sary for the physician to refer to the criteria and esti- mates in several chapters if the impairing condition involves several organ systems. Related but separate conditions are rated separately and impairment rat- ings are combined unless criteria for the second impairment are included in the primary impairment. For example, an individual with an injury causing neurologic and muscular impairment to his upper extremity would be evaluated under the upper extremity criteria in Chapter 16. Any skin impairment due to significant scarring would be rated separately in the skin chapter and combined with the impairment from the upper extremity chapter. Loss of nerve func- tion would be rated within either the musculoskeletal chapters or neurology chapter.",
  "",
  "In the case of two significant yet unrelated condi- tions, each impairment rating is calculated sepa- rately, converted or expressed as a whole person impairment, then combined using the Combined Values Chart (p. 604). The general philosophy of the Combined Values Chart is discussed in Chapter 1.",
  "2.5c Consistency",
  "Consistency tests are designed to ensure reproducibil- ity and greater accuracy. These measurements, such as one that checks the individual\u2019s lumbosacral spine range of motion (Section 15.9) are good but imperfect indicators of people\u2019s efforts. The physician must use the entire range of clinical skill and judgment when assessing whether or not the measurements or tests results are plausible and consistent with the impair- ment being evaluated. If, in spite of an observation or test result, the medical evidence appears insufficient to verify that an impairment of a certain magnitude exists, the physician may modify the impairment rating accordingly and then describe and explain the reason for the modification in writing.",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "2.5d Interpolating, Measuring, and Rounding Off",
  "In deciding where to place an individual\u2019s impair- ment rating within a range, the physician needs to consider all the criteria applicable to the condition, which includes performing activities of daily living, and estimate the degree to which the medical impair- ment interferes with these activities. In some cases, the physician may need additional information to determine where to place an individual in the range.",
  "",
  "As with any biological measurements, some variabil- ity and normal fluctuations are inherent in permanent impairment ratings. Two measurements made by the same examiner using the Guides that involve an indi- vidual or an individual\u2019s functions would be consis- tent if they fall within 10% of each other.",
  "Measurements should also be consistent between two trained observers or by one observer on two sep- arate occasions, assuming the individual\u2019s condition is stable. Repeating measurements may decrease error and result in a measurement that is closer to average function. The final calculated whole person impairment rating, whether it is based on the evalua- tion of one organ system or several organ systems, should be rounded to the nearest whole number.",
  "2.5e Pain",
  "The impairment ratings in the body organ system chapters make allowance for any accompanying pain. Chronic pain, also called chronic pain syn- drome, is discussed in the chapter on pain (Chapter 18).",
  "2.5f Using Assistive Devices in Evaluations If an individual\u2019s prosthesis or assistive device can be removed or its use eliminated relatively easily, the physician should usually test and evaluate the organ system without the device. For example, ask the patient to remove a hearing aid before testing audi- tory acuity. The examiner may choose also to test the system with the assistive device in place and then report both sets of results. The physician may also choose to report alterations in the individual\u2019s organ function with and without use of the device and chal- lenges that are posed by using the device, if any.",
  "",
  "If the assistive device is not easily removable, as with an implanted lens, evaluate the organ system\u2019s functioning with the device in place. Test the visual system with the patient\u2019s glasses or contact lenses in place if they are used.",
  "",
  "2.5g Adjustments for Effects of Treatment or Lack of Treatment",
  "In certain instances, the treatment of an illness may result in apparently total remission of the person\u2019s signs and symptoms. Examples include the treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and the treat- ment of type 1 diabetes mellitus with insulin. Yet it is debatable whether, with treatment, the patient has actually regained the previous status of normal good health. In these instances, the physician may choose to increase the impairment estimate by a small per- centage (eg, 1% to 3%).",
  "",
  "In some instances, as with organ transplant recipients who are treated with immunity-suppressing pharma- ceuticals or persons treated with anticoagulants, the pharmaceuticals themselves may lead to impair- ments. In such an instance, the physician should use the appropriate parts of the Guides to evaluate impairment related to pharmaceutical effects. If information in the Guides is lacking, the physician may combine an estimated impairment percent based on the severity of the effect, with the primary organ system impairment, by means of the Combined Values Chart (p. 604).",
  "",
  "A patient may decline surgical, pharmacologic, or therapeutic treatment of an impairment. If a patient declines therapy for a permanent impairment, that decision neither decreases nor increases the esti- mated percentage of the individual\u2019s impairment. However, the physician may wish to make a written comment in the medical evaluation report about the suitability of the therapeutic approach and describe the basis of the individual\u2019s refusal. The physician may also need to address whether the impairment is at maximal medical improvement without treatment and the degree of anticipated improvement that could be expected with treatment.",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "2.5h Changes in Impairment from Prior Ratings",
  "Although a previous evaluator may have considered a medical impairment to be permanent, unanticipated changes may occur: the condition may have become worse as a result of aggravation or clinical progres- sion, or it may have improved. The physician should assess the current state of the impairment according to the criteria in the Guides. If an individual received an impairment rating from an earlier edition and needs to be reevaluated because of a change in the medical condition, the individual is evaluated according to the latest information pertaining to the condition in the current edition of the Guides.",
  "",
  "Valid assessment of a change in the impairment esti- mate would depend on the reliability of the previous estimate and the evidence upon which it was based. If a prior impairment evaluation was not performed, but sufficient historical information is available to currently estimate the prior impairment, the assess- ment would be performed based on the most recent Guides criteria. However, if the information is insuf- ficient to accurately document the change, then the physician needs to explain that decision and should not estimate a change.",
  "",
  "If apportionment is needed, the analysis must con- sider the nature of the impairment and its relation- ship to each alleged causative factor, providing an explanation of the medical basis for all conclusions and opinions. (Apportionment and causation are con- sidered more fully in Chapter 1 and are briefly defined in the Glossary.) For example, in apportion- ing a spine impairment, first the current spine impairment rating is calculated, and then an impair- ment rating from any preexisting spine problem is calculated. The value for the preexisting impairment rating can be subtracted from the present impairment rating to account for the effects of the intervening injury or disease. Using this approach to apportion- ment requires accurate information and data to deter- mine both impairment ratings. If different editions of the Guides are used, the physician needs to assess their similarity. If the basis of the ratings is similar, a subtraction is appropriate. If they differ markedly, the physician needs to evaluate the circumstances and determine if conversion to the earlier or latest edition of the Guides for both ratings is possible. The determination should follow any state guidelines and should consider whichever edition best describes the individual\u2019s impairment.",
  "",
  "2.6 Preparing Reports",
  "A clear, accurate, and complete report is essential to support a rating of permanent impairment. The fol- lowing elements in bold type should be included in all impairment evaluation reports. Other elements listed in italics are commonly found within an IME or may be requested for inclusion in an impairment evaluation.",
  "2.6a Clinical Evaluation",
  "2.6a.1 Include a narrative history of the medical condition(s) with the onset and course of the condi- tion, symptoms, findings on previous examination(s), treatments, and responses to treatment, including adverse effects. Include information that may be rele- vant to onset, such as an occupational exposure or injury. Historical information should refer to any relevant investigations. Include a detailed list of",
