    "The Guides was first published in book form in 1971 in response to a public need for a standardized, objective approach to evaluating medical impair- ments. Sections of the first edition of the Guides were originally published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, beginning in 1958 and continuing until August 1970.1 Since then, the Guides has undergone four revisions, culminating in the current, fifth edition. The purpose of this fifth edition of the Guides is to update the diagnostic cri- teria and evaluation process used in impairment assessment, incorporating available scientific evi- dence and prevailing medical opinion. Chapter authors were encouraged to use the latest scientific evidence from their specialty and, where evidence was lacking, develop a consensus view. This chapter was revised from the earlier edition in response to specific requests from user groups concerning the definitions, appropriate use, and scope of application of the Guides.",

    "The fifth edition includes most of the common con- ditions, excluding unusual cases that require individ- ual consideration. Since this edition encompasses the most current criteria and procedures for impairment assessment, it is strongly recommended that physi- cians use this latest edition, the fifth edition, when rating impairment.",

    "The Guides continues to define impairment as",
    " a loss, loss of use, or derangement of any body part, organ system, or organ function.  2 This defi- nition of impairment is retained in this edition. A medical impairment can develop from an illness or injury. An impairment is considered permanent when it has reached maximal medical improvement (MMI), meaning it is well stabilized and unlikely to change substantially in the next year with or without medical treatment. The term impairment in the Guides refers to permanent impairment, which is the focus of the Guides.",
    "",
    "An impairment can be manifested objectively, for example, by a fracture, and/or subjectively, through fatigue and pain.3 Although the Guides emphasizes objective assessment, subjective symptoms are included within the diagnostic criteria. According to the Guides, determining whether an injury or illness results in a permanent impairment requires a medical assessment performed by a physician. An impair- ment may lead to functional limitations or the inabil- ity to perform activities of daily living.",
    "",
    "Table 1-1, adapted from a report by the AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, lists various definitions of impairment and disability used by four main authorities: the AMA Guides, the World Health Organization, the Social Security Administration, and a state workers  compensation statute.4 Although a nationally accepted definition for impairment does not exist, the general concept of impairment is simi- lar in the definitions of most organizations. Several terms used in the AMA definition, and their applica- tion throughout the Guides, will be discussed in this chapter and Chapter 2.",
    "",
    "Loss, loss of use, or derangement implies a change from a normal or  preexisting  state. Normal is a range or zone representing healthy functioning and varies with age, gender, and other factors such as environmental conditions. For example, normal heart rate varies between a child and adult and according to whether the person is at rest or exercising.",
    "Multiple factors need to be considered when assess- ing whether a specific or overall function is normal. A normal value can be defined from an individual or population perspective.",
    "",
    "When evaluating an individual, a physician has two options: consider the individual s healthy preinjury or preillness state or the condition of the unaffected side as  normal  for the individual if this is known, or compare that individual to a normal value defined by population averages of healthy people. The Guides uses both approaches. Accepted population values for conditions such as extremity range-of- motion or lung function are listed in the Guides; it is recommended that the physician use those values as detailed in the Guides when applicable. In other cir- cumstances, for instance, where population values are not available, the physician should use clinical judgment regarding normal structure and function and estimate what is normal for the individual based on the physician s knowledge or estimate of the indi- vidual s preinjury or preillness condition.",
