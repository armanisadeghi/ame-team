## Pretty print

- vcprint - Looks for a variable named "VERBOSE" in your script and prints accordingly. Also offers color print and pretty print built in, as well as a title for your prints.
- cool_print - Allows for colorful and styled prints.
- pretty_print - Very good at printing things that pprint cannot possibly print!
- print_link - Converts things into a link in the terminal. - it's mostly tested for pycharm so if you use a different IDE and it doesn't work, help us update it.
